Opening Scene:
The hum of airplane engines fades as you step off the small commuter flight into the familiar scent of freshly tilled earth. Golden Valley hasn’t changed much since you left, but the weight of your purpose presses heavily on your chest. A short drive brings you to the family farm, a place you hadn’t seen in years—a place you never thought you’d return to as anything more than a visitor.

You park by the old barn, its paint peeling and the doors hanging slightly ajar. The equipment yard looks more like a scrapyard, with rusted combines and broken plows scattered haphazardly. The farmhouse door creaks open, and your younger brother stumbles out, clearly stressed.

“It’s worse than I thought,” you mutter under your breath.

Flashback Sequence (Narrated by the Player):
"Grandpa always said the Co-Op was nothing but trouble. He warned us never to get involved, never to trust them. But after he passed, Dad thought he knew better. He joined the Co-Op, thinking it would secure a future for the farm. Instead, it became a noose around our necks.

The Co-Op’s rules were impossible—what to plant, when to harvest, where to sell. They reserved the best contracts for the old guard and punished anyone who tried to go their own way. And when the family fell on hard times, the Co-Op was there—not to help, but to lend. Dad borrowed too much, thinking he could outwork the debt, but the terms were stacked against him. Now, here we are: ten million in the hole, with most of the land repossessed and the farm barely hanging on.

I thought I’d left this all behind when I became a commodities broker. Canola was my specialty—I knew the markets, the contracts, the players. But when I heard the farm was in trouble, I couldn’t just sit back. I thought I’d be here for a few days, maybe a week, to help with a harvest. Instead, I found... this."

Transition to Gameplay:
You take a deep breath, looking over the farm. It’s a shadow of what it once was, but there’s still potential here. You’ve already done the impossible—liquidated your assets, paid off the lion’s share of the debt, and renegotiated the rest. The bank has given you breathing room, but now it’s up to you. You’re the farm manager, and this is your chance to save the family legacy.

A distant rumble catches your attention—a battered old tractor sputters to life. You smirk despite yourself. "Alright, time to get to work."

Gameplay Start:
You begin with:

A single field, prepped for planting.
A small amount of starter capital (~$500k) after covering the debt.
Basic, heavily used equipment in need of upgrades or repairs.
A looming Co-Op presence, which you’ll need to navigate carefully.

Let's create the dialogue, for the phone call I received let's me know that the family farm is in trouble. The call comes from my mother, but she is quite and won't say to much, just that your father needs your help, but is to stubborn to ask. She pleads for me to come home just for the weekend and talk to your father.

Here’s the dialogue for the phone call from your mother, setting the emotional tone for your return to the family farm:

Phone Call Scene
(Your phone buzzes on the desk as you glance at the caller ID: “Mom.” You haven’t spoken in a few months, and her calling now feels... off. You answer, curious but wary.)

Player:
"Hey, Mom. What’s up? Everything okay?"

Mom: (hesitant, voice trembling slightly)
"Hi, honey. I—I didn’t want to bother you, but... I didn’t know who else to call."

Player:
"Mom, what’s going on? You sound upset."

Mom:
"It’s your father. He’s... he’s in trouble, but you know how he is. He’s too proud to ask for help. Too stubborn to admit when he’s drowning."

Player:
"What kind of trouble are we talking about? Is he okay?"

Mom: (pauses, her voice quiet)
"The farm. It’s... it’s worse than we let on. I don’t know the details—he won’t tell me everything. But I know it’s bad, really bad. He’s been so stressed. I’m worried about his health, about the farm, about everything."

Player:
"Mom, you’re scaring me. How bad is it? What’s going on?"

Mom: (struggles to find the words)
"I just... I need you to come home. Just for the weekend. Talk to your father, please. He won’t listen to me, but maybe he’ll listen to you."

Player: (sighs, torn between responsibilities and concern)
"Mom, you know my job is insane right now. I can’t just drop everything for a weekend."

Mom: (pleading)
"Please, honey. He needs you, even if he won’t admit it. We need you. It’s not just about the farm—it’s about your father. I think... I think he’s losing hope. Just come home. Please."

Player: (pauses, guilt and worry creeping in)
"Alright, Mom. I’ll come. But just for the weekend. We’ll see what’s going on, and maybe I can help straighten things out."

Mom: (relieved, almost in tears)
"Thank you. I knew I could count on you. Drive safe, honey. I’ll see you soon."

(She hangs up before you can ask more, leaving you staring at your phone. The weight of the conversation settles on you. This wasn’t just about the farm. Something bigger was wrong, and you needed to find out what.)

The next scene is us traveling back home. It is a 8 hour drive back home, a lot of time for quick backstory little stories about life on the family farm when he was younger and grandpa ran everything. The family farm was one of if not the biggest in the region. It was that farm that paid for all of our school to become as successful has I have. However, you and your father had a major falling out after grandpa passed. The falling out was over joining the local Co-Op. My last words to my father were. "I am done, I will not stand by and watch you run this farm into the ground. Grandpa warned you. Yet you won't listen. When you lose everything, don't come crying to me to save you!" so we need let's say 3 scenes of kind of internal dialog of what I am thinking as I travel home.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s a breakdown of three scenes of internal dialogue as you travel home, adding depth to the story and giving insight into the character’s feelings, backstory, and emotional conflict:

Scene 1: Leaving the City
(The car engine hums as you merge onto the highway. The city skyline fades in your rearview mirror, replaced by rolling hills and open fields. Your thoughts drift as the miles stretch out ahead.)

Internal Dialogue:
"Eight hours. Eight hours to figure out how I’m supposed to talk to him. What do I even say? 'Hey, Dad, remember me? The kid who walked out on you after calling you stubborn and reckless?' Yeah, that’ll go over great."

"It’s been years. The last time we spoke... God, I can still hear the words. ‘Grandpa warned you,’ I said. ‘When you lose everything, don’t come crying to me to save you.’ And now here I am, racing back to save him. The irony’s not lost on me."

(You grip the wheel tighter, frustration bubbling up.)
"Mom didn’t say much, but it’s obvious. This isn’t just about the farm. It’s about Dad, about what he’s become. And maybe... maybe it’s about me, too. What kind of person would I be if I didn’t try?"

Scene 2: Halfway There – Remembering Grandpa
(The landscape changes, with open farmland stretching endlessly on either side. The sights stir old memories.)

Internal Dialogue:
"Grandpa would’ve known what to do. He always did. The farm was his kingdom, and he ruled it with a mix of wisdom and stubborn pride. He made it look easy—balancing the books, keeping the workers happy, planting the right crops at the right time. He didn’t just grow food; he grew a legacy."

"It’s that legacy that sent me to college, paid for every textbook, every meal. Grandpa said, ‘The farm will take care of you, as long as you take care of it.’ I wonder what he’d think of it now. Of Dad, of me... of what’s left."

(You glance at the passenger seat, where an old photo of Grandpa rests in a frame you brought from your office. It’s from a better time—his arm around you as you stood proudly beside the tractor.)
"He’d probably tell me to stop overthinking and just fix the damn thing. ‘The land doesn’t care about your feelings,’ he used to say. ‘It just wants to be worked.’"

Scene 3: The Final Stretch – Facing the Past
(The sun sets as you approach Golden Valley. The familiar roads feel strange after so many years, each turn bringing back a flood of memories.)

Internal Dialogue:
"I don’t even know if he’ll want to see me. Knowing Dad, he’s probably still angry. Hell, I’m still angry. But it’s not about me, is it? It’s about the farm, about saving what’s left. Maybe if I focus on that, we’ll get through this without killing each other."

"This place used to be a giant, the pride of the valley. It’s where I learned to drive a tractor, where I got my first paycheck, where I used to sit and listen to Grandpa’s stories about building it all from nothing. And now... now it’s just another struggling farm with too much debt and not enough hope."

(You see the first sign welcoming you to Golden Valley. The knot in your stomach tightens.)
"I don’t know if I can fix this. I don’t even know if I should. But if I don’t try... if I just let it all fall apart... I’ll regret it for the rest of my life."

(The farmhouse comes into view, its silhouette dark against the twilight. You take a deep breath and grip the wheel.)
"Alright, let’s do this."

I think we need to set the scene of the farm's state. The pain bright red barn that was a symbol of the farm to you as a child was no longer red and looks like it is falling a part. Grandpa's house looks almost abandoned, your father unable to keep up with the maintenance. The grass is overgrown. As I pull up I see my father working on a tractor that looks older than him, there are 4 other tractors and harvesters around that all look rundown and not working. The remaining equipment is all old and need a lot of TLC. The one remaining field is full of wheat ready to harvest. So that something that is good.

Here’s a vivid scene to set the tone for the farm’s current state as you arrive:

Arriving at the Farm
(Your tires crunch on the gravel driveway as you pull up to the family farm. The sight before you stops you cold. This isn’t the farm you remember. This isn’t the home that Grandpa built with his bare hands, the place that once stood as a symbol of pride and success in Golden Valley.)

The barn, once a vibrant red that could be spotted from miles away, now looks like a ghost of itself. Its paint has faded into a dull, peeling brown, and sections of the roof sag dangerously. The doors hang askew, one barely clinging to its hinges.

Grandpa’s house, the heart of the farm and a place that once bustled with life, looks almost abandoned. The windows are grimy, and the porch steps are warped and splintered. The grass around the house is overgrown, weeds choking the flowerbeds where Grandma once grew her prized roses.

(You step out of the car, taking in the scene as a lump forms in your throat. This isn’t how it was supposed to be.)

To your left, your father is hunched over a tractor that looks like it came out of a museum. He’s covered in grease, muttering under his breath as he wrestles with a stubborn bolt. Around him, four other machines—tractors, a harvester—sit idle, their rusted exteriors and flat tires a testament to years of neglect.

(You take a few hesitant steps closer, your eyes scanning the rest of the yard. The equipment shed is wide open, but it’s not the organized space you remember. Tools are scattered everywhere, and parts are strewn across the ground. It’s chaos.)

Beyond the chaos, there’s a single bright spot—a field of wheat, golden and swaying gently in the breeze. It’s ready for harvest, the only sign of life in an otherwise crumbling legacy.

(You stop a few feet away from your father, who still hasn’t noticed you. You take a deep breath, steeling yourself for what’s to come.)

First Interaction with Your Father
(You approach the tractor slowly, the sound of your boots crunching on the gravel breaking the silence. Your father doesn’t look up, too focused on the stubborn bolt he’s wrestling with. You stop a few feet away, hands on your hips, and decide to break the ice with one of Grandpa’s old sayings.)

Player: (dryly, with a hint of nostalgia)
"You know, if you spent more time on the tractor instead of under it, you might make a farmer someday."

(Your father freezes for a moment, his hand tightening on the wrench. Slowly, he straightens up, turning to face you. His expression is a mix of surprise and annoyance, but there’s no warmth in his eyes.)

Father: (gruffly)
"What are you doing here?"

Player: (shrugs)
"Got a call from Mom. She said you could use a hand. Figured I’d come down for the weekend, see what’s going on."

Father: (mutters, shaking his head)
"I told her not to bother you. I don’t need help. Especially not yours."

(The words hit harder than you expected, but you keep your composure.)

Player:
"Yeah, well, it doesn’t look like things are going great around here. Mom’s worried about you. And frankly, after seeing all this, I’m worried too."

(You gesture toward the rusted equipment and overgrown yard. Your father’s jaw tightens, his pride clearly wounded.)

Father:
"This farm’s been through worse. I’ll manage."

Player: (sharply)
"Manage? Dad, the barn’s falling apart, the house looks like no one’s lived in it for years, and your equipment’s one flat tire away from being scrap metal. This isn’t managing—it’s barely holding on."

(Your father glares at you, his voice rising.)

Father:
"You think you can just waltz in here after all these years and tell me how to run this farm? You don’t know the first thing about what I’ve been through, about the decisions I’ve had to make!"

Player: (angrily)
"I know enough to see that Grandpa’s legacy is hanging by a thread. You think this is what he wanted? To see everything he built fall apart because you wouldn’t listen to him—or to anyone else?"

(The tension hangs thick between you. Your father exhales sharply, his anger giving way to exhaustion. He rubs his forehead, looking older than you’ve ever seen him.)

Father: (quieter)
"You don’t understand. It’s not that simple. The Co-Op... they’ve got their hooks in everything. The land, the contracts, even the seeds. They’re the only reason this farm’s still standing. Barely."

Player: (calming down, but still firm)
"Maybe. But I’m here now, and I’m not going to let this place go under. Like it or not, I’m staying. At least until we figure this out."

(Your father studies you for a moment, his expression unreadable. Finally, he sighs and turns back to the tractor.)

Father: (grumbling)
"Suit yourself. But don’t think you can come in here and fix everything overnight. This isn’t one of your fancy office deals—it’s real life."

(You watch as he picks up his wrench and goes back to work. The conversation isn’t over, but for now, it’s enough. You glance toward the wheat field, the golden stalks swaying in the breeze. There’s work to be done.)

Since it would be getting late into the evening and I know mom always has dinner ready at 7 PM sharp. I look at my father and tell him "Come on, old man. Let's go inside for dinner before mom has to come out here and get you." Knowing that mom was always a little upset when any of us were late to family dinner. He agrees and cleans up and follows me in. As we enter the house the smell for mom's cooking fills the air and it is like I am rushed back to childhood. my father say "Hey, look what I found washed up on the riverbank" and he points to you. My mother runs other and hugs me and whispers "Thank you for coming". My younger, but much bigger brother Joseph just says "Welcome Home, little bro", and softly punches me in the shoulder (I try not to so that it hurt like hell). My little sister Julie questions "This doesn't me I have to give back his room does it". My father answers quickly in a somewhat angered tone. "No, he is only here for the weekend, to fix everything your mom thinks I broke"

Here’s how that warm and slightly tense dinner scene might play out, bringing in the family dynamics and nostalgia:

Dinner Scene: Coming Back Home
(You glance at your father, who’s still hunched over the tractor, wiping grease off his hands with a rag that looks like it’s seen better days.)

Player: (teasingly)
"Come on, old man. Let’s go inside for dinner before Mom has to come out here and drag you in herself."

(Your father snorts, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips despite himself.)

Father:
"She’d do it, too."

(He tosses the rag onto the tractor and grabs his toolbox.)

Father:
"Alright, let’s go. But don’t think this means I’m done with that bolt."

(The two of you walk toward the house, the fading sunlight casting long shadows across the yard. As you step onto the creaky porch and open the door, the smell of Mom’s cooking hits you like a wave. It’s the same comforting aroma that filled your childhood—roast chicken, fresh biscuits, and something sweet baking in the oven. For a moment, you’re transported back to simpler times, before everything fell apart.)

(Your father steps in behind you, calling out loudly.)

Father:
"Hey, look what I found washed up on the riverbank!"

(You roll your eyes as your mom rushes over, her apron dusted with flour. She wraps you in a tight hug, her voice soft as she whispers in your ear.)

Mom:
"Thank you for coming."

(Before you can respond, your younger brother Joseph enters the room, ducking slightly to avoid hitting his head on the doorframe. He’s grown even bigger since you last saw him—broad shoulders, calloused hands, and a mischievous grin.)

Joseph: (grinning)
"Welcome home, little bro."

(He throws a playful punch at your shoulder. You try not to flinch, but the impact stings more than you’d like to admit.)

Player: (wincing, rubbing your shoulder)
"Still don’t know your own strength, huh?"

Joseph: (chuckling)
"Just keeping you on your toes."

(Your little sister Julie peeks out from the kitchen, her arms crossed and a smirk on her face.)

Julie:
"This doesn’t mean I have to give his room back, does it?"

(Before you can answer, your father interjects, his tone sharp and a little defensive.)

Father:
"No, he’s only here for the weekend—to fix everything your mom thinks I broke."

(The tension is back, but your mom quickly smooths it over, ushering everyone toward the table.)

Mom:
"Alright, enough of that. Dinner’s ready, and I won’t have it getting cold because you all can’t keep your mouths shut."

(The table is set just like it always was—family-style, with steaming dishes passed around. For the first time in years, you’re all sitting together, and while the undercurrent of tension remains, there’s also something comforting about it. Maybe, just maybe, there’s still hope to salvage more than just the farm.)

Would you like help developing the dinner conversation, focusing on lighthearted family banter or setting up subtle hints about the Co-Op's control and your father's struggles?

You said:
I think for the most part dinner is just a typical family dinner, we talk about what we have kind of been up to. I tell them about the multi-million dollar deals I have closed in the last couple of weeks. Joseph tells me about helping dad start to get what they can repaired, and some interesting and somewhat foreshadowing things about the Co-Op, which he works for to bring in some money to the house. Julie tells story about school and the talent show she won for her singing. again unknowingly foreshadows something about the Co-Op. Mom talks about how she had to change some recipes because of the strange flavor from some of the Co-Op food.

Here’s the dinner scene, blending the warmth of a family meal with subtle foreshadowing about the Co-Op’s influence:

Dinner Scene: Around the Table
(The clatter of plates and the scrape of chairs fill the dining room as everyone takes their seats. The food looks incredible—roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and freshly baked biscuits. For a moment, it feels like old times. Then, the conversations begin.)

Mom: (smiling as she passes the chicken)
"It’s been a while since we’ve all been around this table. Feels good, doesn’t it?"

Julie: (teasing)
"As long as he doesn’t steal all the biscuits like he used to."

Player: (grinning)
"No promises."

(The table chuckles as everyone begins to eat. It doesn’t take long for the conversation to flow naturally.)

Player’s Update
Player: (after a few bites)
"Things have been busy on my end. Closed a couple of multi-million dollar deals the past few weeks. Canola contracts, mostly."

Joseph: (raising an eyebrow)
"Still dealing in canola, huh? Seems like you can’t escape it, no matter how far you run."

Player: (shrugging)
"It’s good business. High demand, decent margins. Besides, it’s not like I expected to end up back here, eating dinner with you lot."

Father: (gruffly)
"Well, don’t get too comfortable. This isn’t exactly your high-rise office."

(The tension is quickly defused as Julie jumps in.)

Julie’s Story
Julie: (beaming)
"Speaking of high-rises, I had my moment in the spotlight last week. Won the school talent show with my singing!"

Player: (smiling)
"That’s awesome, Julie! What did you sing?"

Julie:
"A song I wrote. It was about the valley, how it’s changing. One of the judges said it was ‘raw and real.’ Guess that’s why I won."

(She pauses, her expression dimming slightly.)

Julie:
"Though Mr. Carter—the one from the Co-Op—didn’t look too happy about it. He said I should’ve focused on something... uplifting."

Mom: (cutting in, her tone protective)
"Well, I think it was perfect. And if the Co-Op doesn’t like it, that’s their problem."

(The mention of the Co-Op shifts the mood slightly, but Joseph keeps the conversation going.)

Joseph’s Update
Joseph: (leaning back in his chair)
"Well, while you’ve been making big deals, I’ve been helping Dad get the equipment running. We got the old baler working last week, but the combine... that’s going to be a project."

Player:
"Sounds like you’ve had your hands full."

Joseph: (chuckling)
"Yeah, but it’s not just the farm. I’ve been working for the Co-Op to bring in some extra money. Driving trucks, mostly."

Player:
"The Co-Op, huh? How’s that been?"

Joseph: (hesitant, choosing his words carefully)
"Let’s just say... they’re particular. Real particular about what goes where and who gets what. Feels like there’s always a bigger plan, and we’re just cogs in the machine."

(Your father shifts uncomfortably but doesn’t say anything. Mom quickly changes the subject.)

Mom’s Comments
Mom: (smiling but with a hint of frustration)
"Speaking of the Co-Op, I had to tweak my recipes again. Something about their flour has this... strange aftertaste. I don’t know what they’ve been doing to the wheat, but it’s not like it used to be."

Julie: (teasing)
"Still better than Dad’s cooking."

Father: (gruffly)
"Hey, now."

(Laughter fills the room, and for a moment, the weight of the farm’s struggles is forgotten. The conversation drifts to lighter topics, but the undercurrent of tension remains, lurking just beneath the surface.)

After dinner is finished, and Joseph and Julie retire to their bedrooms. I finally get the courage, to ask my mom and dad to sit down and go over what is really wrong and the state of the farm. As my dad start explaining what happened, and how bad the situation actually is, I get angry, but this time I hold it in for the most part. My only questions to my father is "What is the plan? How is he planning on fixing this?", his answer do no convince me that he has a clue on what to do next. So my next question is, "How do you want me to help?", is answer is angry and reminds me that he wasn't the one that called me. My mom interrupts him, and tells him that he needs to stop with the stubbornness. So my next question is "How long before you lose everything?"

Here’s how that late-night conversation might unfold, revealing the dire situation while building emotional tension:

Late-Night Conversation: The Truth Comes Out
(The table is cleared, and the house quiets as Joseph and Julie retreat to their rooms. You sit in the living room, the soft glow of the lamp casting long shadows. Your parents join you, Mom settling into her favorite armchair while Dad sits stiffly on the worn-out couch. You take a deep breath, steeling yourself for the conversation.)

Player: (calmly but firmly)
"Alright. It’s time. I need to know the truth. What’s really going on with the farm?"

(Your father crosses his arms, leaning back defensively. Mom exchanges a worried glance with you, then nods toward him.)

Father: (reluctantly)
"It’s no secret the farm’s been struggling since your grandpa passed. Losing his knowledge, his connections... it put us on the back foot. Then the Co-Op started tightening its grip—restricting who we could sell to, what we could grow. They made it harder and harder to stay afloat."

Player:
"But that’s not the whole story, is it? How did it get this bad?"

Father: (sighing heavily)
"I took out loans. Big ones. The Co-Op promised better terms if I followed their guidelines—planting their crops, using their suppliers. But the yields weren’t what they promised, and the prices... the prices barely covered costs. Before I knew it, we were in over our heads."

Mom: (quietly, looking down)
"It’s not just the loans. We lost three fields last year—reclaimed by the bank. And the equipment... we couldn’t afford the repairs, so we just kept patching it up until now."

(Your chest tightens as the weight of their words sinks in. You lean forward, your voice steady but edged with anger.)

Player:
"So what’s the plan, Dad? How are you planning on fixing this?"

(Your father’s jaw tightens, and he looks away, unable to meet your eyes.)

Father: (after a long pause)
"I’m... I’m working on it. We’ve got the wheat field ready for harvest. That’ll give us something to pay down the loan."

Player: (frustrated but holding it in)
"That’s not a plan. That’s a patch. How are you going to fix this long-term? Or do you even have a clue what to do next?"

(Your father bristles, his pride wounded.)

Father: (snapping)
"I don’t need you coming in here, acting like you know better. You weren’t the one trying to keep this place alive! And I wasn’t the one who called you!"

(The words sting, but before you can respond, Mom cuts in, her voice sharp.)

Mom:
"Enough! Both of you. This isn’t about pride or blame—it’s about saving this farm. You’ve been stubborn long enough, and now we’re all paying for it. You need to let him help."

(Your father grumbles under his breath but doesn’t argue. You lean back, exhaling slowly, then ask the question you’ve been dreading.)

Player: (calmly but pointedly)
"How long before you lose everything?"

(Your father hesitates, the silence stretching painfully. Finally, he speaks, his voice quieter than before.)

Father:
"A few months, maybe. If we can’t pay the next installment on the loan, they’ll take the rest of the land. After that... there’s nothing left."

(The gravity of his words hits hard, but it also strengthens your resolve. You glance at Mom, who gives you a small, hopeful nod.)

Player: (after a long pause)
"Alright. We don’t have time to waste. First thing tomorrow, we figure out what we can do with what’s left. I’ll help, but we’re doing this my way. Deal?"

(Your father doesn’t answer right away. Finally, he nods reluctantly, his pride taking a backseat to necessity.)

Father:
"Deal."

(The conversation ends, but the weight of what lies ahead lingers as you prepare for the fight to save the farm.)

Would you like help planning the next day’s tasks, such as assessing the equipment, harvesting the wheat, or investigating the Co-Op’s influence?

I want to change the following part of the conversation, I don't want my character to say that you will do it my way. Instead I would rather him to set a short goal. Let his mother and father know that tomorrow you will all go over the books and see what can be done, that you will call a few of your lawyer friends to see what you can do legally and start liquidating as must of your assets as possible to try and get the loan paid down and restructured:

"It’s no secret the farm’s been struggling since your grandpa passed. Losing his knowledge, his connections... it put us on the back foot. Then the Co-Op started tightening its grip—restricting who we could sell to, what we could grow. They made it harder and harder to stay afloat."

**Player:**
"But that’s not the whole story, is it? How did it get this bad?"

**Father:** _(sighing heavily)_
"I took out loans. Big ones. The Co-Op promised better terms if I followed their guidelines—planting their crops, using their suppliers. But the yields weren’t what they promised, and the prices... the prices barely covered costs. Before I knew it, we were in over our heads."

**Mom:** _(quietly, looking down)_
"It’s not just the loans. We lost three fields last year—reclaimed by the bank. And the equipment... we couldn’t afford the repairs, so we just kept patching it up until now."

_(Your chest tightens as the weight of their words sinks in. You lean forward, your voice steady but edged with anger.)_

**Player:**
"So what’s the plan, Dad? How are you planning on fixing this?"

_(Your father’s jaw tightens, and he looks away, unable to meet your eyes.)_

**Father:** _(after a long pause)_
"I’m... I’m working on it. We’ve got the wheat field ready for harvest. That’ll give us something to pay down the loan."

**Player:** _(frustrated but holding it in)_
"That’s not a plan. That’s a patch. How are you going to fix this long-term? Or do you even have a clue what to do next?"

_(Your father bristles, his pride wounded.)_

**Father:** _(snapping)_
"I don’t need you coming in here, acting like you know better. You weren’t the one trying to keep this place alive! And I wasn’t the one who called you!"

_(The words sting, but before you can respond, Mom cuts in, her voice sharp.)_

**Mom:**
"Enough! Both of you. This isn’t about pride or blame—it’s about saving this farm. You’ve been stubborn long enough, and now we’re all paying for it. You need to let him help."

_(Your father grumbles under his breath but doesn’t argue. You lean back, exhaling slowly, then ask the question you’ve been dreading.)_

**Player:** _(calmly but pointedly)_
"How long before you lose everything?"

_(Your father hesitates, the silence stretching painfully. Finally, he speaks, his voice quieter than before.)_

**Father:**
"A few months, maybe. If we can’t pay the next installment on the loan, they’ll take the rest of the land. After that... there’s nothing left."

_(The gravity of his words hits hard, but it also strengthens your resolve. You glance at Mom, who gives you a small, hopeful nod.)_

**Player:** _(after a long pause)_
"Alright. Here’s what we’re going to do. Tomorrow, we’ll sit down and go over the books, see what can be done. I’ll call a few of my lawyer friends and see what our legal options are. And I’ll start liquidating what I can on my end to help pay down the loan and restructure it."

_(Your father looks at you, his pride battling with the reality of the situation. Finally, he nods, his voice gruff.)_

**Father:**
"Fine. But don’t expect miracles."

_(Your mom reaches over and squeezes your hand, her expression one of gratitude and relief.)_

**Mom:**
"Thank you. Both of you."

_(The conversation ends, the weight of the decisions ahead settling over you all as you prepare for the work to come.)_

### The Next Morning: Making Plans

_(The morning sunlight filters through the curtains as you sip on a cup of coffee at the kitchen table. The house is quiet, except for the occasional creak of floorboards. You spent most of the night combing through your finances, calculating how much you can liquidate and how quickly it can be done. Before it gets too late, you pick up your phone and make a call.)_

_(The phone rings twice before a familiar voice answers.)_

**Lawyer Friend:** _(cheerful but professional)_
"Hey there! Long time no talk. What’s got you calling so early?"

**Player:**
"Morning. I wish this was a social call, but I’ve got a situation on my hands. I’m back at the family farm, and it’s bad. Real bad. I need some advice on Co-Ops—specifically, what they can and can’t legally do."

**Lawyer Friend:** _(pausing, their tone shifting to serious)_
"Alright, I’m listening. Give me the details."

_(You explain the farm’s struggles, the Co-Op’s restrictive practices, and the looming threat of foreclosure. Your friend listens intently, occasionally chiming in with clarifying questions.)_

**Lawyer Friend:**
"Okay, here’s the deal. Co-Ops operate under specific regulations. They’re supposed to work for the benefit of their members, but it sounds like this one’s playing dirty. If they’re prioritizing senior members or using predatory practices, there might be a case. I’ll need to look into it more, but I can definitely help."

**Player:**
"That’s exactly what I needed to hear. Thanks. I’ll send over any documents you might need later today."

**Lawyer Friend:**
"You’ve got it. Hang in there, alright? We’ll figure this out."

_(You hang up, feeling a flicker of hope. The path ahead is still daunting, but at least you’re starting to see a way forward. As the morning progresses, you prepare for the family meeting to go over the books and make a plan.)_

### Breakfast: Starting the Day

_(The sound of footsteps on the stairs signals the start of the day. Your mom enters the kitchen first, giving you a warm hug.)_

**Mom:**
"Good morning, sweetheart."

**Player:** _(smiling)_
"Morning, Mom. I made coffee."

_(Your father enters next, his usual gruff demeanor intact.)_

**Father:** _(sarcastically)_
"It isn’t that fancy city crap... Frapacrappion or whatever the hell it’s called, is it?"

**Player:** _(chuckling)_
"No, Dad. It’s normal coffee."

_(You pour cups for both your mom and dad. Mom takes a sip, then glances at the table covered in paperwork.)_

**Mom:**
"Are you planning on keeping the kitchen table buried in all this, or can I make breakfast?"

**Player:** _(grinning sheepishly)_
"I’ll clear it off."

_(As Joseph and Julie come downstairs, Mom directs them with her usual no-nonsense tone.)_

**Mom:**
"Help your brother clean off the table for breakfast."

_(The table is cleared quickly, and everyone sits down as Mom serves breakfast. The comforting aroma of pancakes and bacon fills the air. As everyone starts eating, your father looks at you expectantly.)_

**Father:**
"So, what have you figured out?"

_(You hesitate, your eyes flicking to Mom and Dad, then to Joseph and Julie, gauging whether it’s okay to discuss everything in front of them.)_

**Player:** _(after a pause)_
"I just got off the phone with a friend of mine. He specializes in farm operations and Co-Op legality. I’ll be sending over the paperwork later so he can start looking into what we might be able to do."

**Father:** _(raising an eyebrow)_
"And the money? How are you planning to cover this mess?"

**Player:** _(steady but serious)_
"I can’t cover all of it, but I can get about 80%. That should be enough to restructure the rest of the loan and give us some breathing room. Maybe even lease some new equipment to get things moving."

**Father:** _(incredulous)_
"Eighty percent? How in the hell are you going to come up with that much?"

**Player:** _(pausing for a moment)_
"Most of it comes from my investments—stocks, mutual funds, and a few other holdings I’ve built up over the years. I’ll have to liquidate almost all of it to get the cash. Then there’s my car—it’s more than I need, and selling it will add to the total. I might even sell some personal items, like furniture and electronics, but those are minor compared to the portfolio."

**Father:** _(his voice softening slightly)_
"You’re really willing to give all that up for this place?"

**Player:** _(looking directly at him)_ "It’s not about the place, Dad. It’s about the people. This is home. And if selling off what I’ve got can give us a fighting chance, then it’s worth it. right?"

**Father:** _(after a moment of silence, his voice quiet but sincere)_ "You’re a better man than I thought, son. Maybe... maybe we’ve got a chance after all."

### Equipment Assessment: Post-Breakfast

_(After breakfast, the plates are cleared, and you turn to your father and Joseph with a determined look.)_

**Player:**
"Alright, let’s get started. I need a full rundown of what we’ve got for equipment and the condition it’s in. No sugarcoating."

**Father:** _(nodding, gesturing toward the equipment yard outside)_
"Fine. Let’s head out."

_(The three of you step outside, the morning sun casting long shadows over the rusted and weathered machinery. Your father begins pointing out each piece.)_

**Father:**
"That there’s the old harvester. It’s seen better days. Needs a new header and the engine’s temperamental, but it’ll run if you coax it right."

**Joseph:** _(chiming in)_
"The baler works, but barely. It jams a lot, and the belts are worn. We’ve patched it up as best we could."

**Father:** _(motioning to a row of tractors)_
"Two tractors—one’s out of commission completely, needs a new transmission. The other... well, it’s holding on, but I wouldn’t bet on it lasting the season."

**Player:** _(taking mental notes)_
"Alright. What else?"

**Joseph:** _(pointing to a smaller trailer in the corner)_
"That trailer over there’s still good. Tires are decent, and it’s sturdy enough. We’ve been using it for smaller loads."

**Joseph:** _(gesturing toward a brand-new mower deck covered in dust)_
"Oh, and we’ve got this front mower deck—brand new, never used. Only problem is, the tractor that can run it is the one with the broken transmission.""

**Father:** _(sighing)_
"Most of the other equipment is either outdated or in worse shape than what you see here. We’ve been scavenging parts just to keep things running."

**Player:** _(after a moment of silence, nodding)_
"Got it. We’ll need to prioritize. Let’s make a list of what absolutely has to be fixed and what we might need to replace outright. We’ll figure out the rest as we go."

### Scene: Standing at the Edge of the Wheat Field

_(The three of you stand at the edge of the golden wheat field, the stalks swaying gently in the breeze. The air is thick with the smell of the ripe grain and the faint hum of insects. You break the silence, looking toward the harvester parked nearby.)_

**Player:**  
"So if we get a header for the harvester, will it run long enough to harvest this field?"

**Father:** _(gruffly, shaking his head)_  
"With our luck, we’ll be lucky to get half the field harvested before it’s down for good."

**Joseph:** _(quickly, his tone defensive)_  
"That’s not true, Dad. I’ve been working on the harvester, and I’m pretty sure it’s ready to go. I checked the hydraulics, cleaned out the fuel lines, and replaced the belts. It’s not perfect, but it should get the job done."

**Father:** _(grumbling but slightly relenting)_  
"If you say so. But don’t come crying to me when it quits halfway through."

**Player:** _(interjecting to refocus)_  
"Alright, let’s figure out what we need to get this field harvested today. What’s the bare minimum to get us through?"

**Joseph:** _(counting on his fingers)_  
"We need a header for sure, diesel fuel for the harvester, and grease for the fittings. I think we’re low on hydraulic fluid too."

**Father:** _(nodding)_  
"And make sure we’ve got enough tools on hand. If that thing breaks down, we’ll need to fix it on the spot."

**Player:** _(mentally noting the list)_  
"Header, diesel, grease, hydraulic fluid, and tools. Anything else?"

**Joseph:**  
"I’ll double-check the tires. Last thing we need is a blowout."

**Father:** _(pausing, then adding)_  
"And make sure the grain trailer’s ready. If we do get the harvester running, we’ll need somewhere to offload."

**Player:** _(nodding decisively)_  
"Alright, let’s split up. Joseph, you check the harvester and the trailer. Dad and I will head into town to get the supplies. We meet back here in two hours to get started."

**Joseph:** _(grinning slightly)_  
"Sounds like a plan. Let’s get this done."

_(The three of you exchange determined looks before heading off to tackle your tasks, the weight of the day’s work settling over you but with a glimmer of hope that this field might just be the first step toward turning things around.)_

### Scene: Timelapse - Gathering Supplies

_(The drive into town with your father is filled with a mix of practical conversation and quiet reflection. At the tractor store, you purchase a new header and a trailer to transport it back to the farm. Loading everything onto the truck, you feel a sense of urgency but also a spark of determination. The return trip is quicker, the weight of the supplies lighter than the thought of what’s to come.)_

_(Back at the farm, you pull into the yard to find Joseph standing proudly next to the harvester. The machine is running, a steady hum signaling his success. He waves as you park.)_

**Joseph:** _(grinning)_  
"Told you it was ready! I’ve gone over everything twice. She’s good to go."

**Father:** _(gruff but approving)_  
"Alright, let’s see if you’re right."

**Player:** _(nodding)_  
"Good work, Joseph. Let’s get the header mounted and everything else ready. We’ve got a field to harvest."

### Scene: Timelapse - Harvesting the Field

_(The harvester roars to life as the first rows of wheat are cut and funneled into the grain bin. The process is steady, and despite a few minor breakdowns—a loose belt here, a clogged chute there—your father and Joseph handle each issue quickly and efficiently. You help where you can, but mostly you stay back, letting their expertise take over.)_

_(The golden wheat gradually disappears row by row, replaced by neat stubble and the satisfaction of progress. The grain trailer fills steadily, the first tangible reward of the day’s efforts.)_

_(As the sun begins to set, the last of the wheat is harvested. The field stands empty, and the grain is ready to be stored or sold. The three of you gather near the harvester, tired but triumphant.)_

**Player:** _(wiping sweat from your brow)_  
"We did it. First step done."

**Father:** _(nodding, his tone lighter than before)_  
"Not bad. Not bad at all."

**Joseph:** _(smiling proudly)_  
"Told you she’d hold up."

_(As you begin putting away the equipment, proud of what you’ve accomplished, the calm is broken by your mom’s voice calling from the house.)_

**Mom:** _(yelling from the porch)_  
"Are you three going to make me come out there, or are you coming in for dinner?"

_(In unison, the three of you snap to attention.)_

**All:**  
"Oh shit!"

**Player:** _(yelling back)_  
"We’re coming!"

\*(The three of you quickly finish tidying up, exchanging amused glances as you head toward the house, the smell of dinner already wafting through the air.)

_(The three of you share a rare moment of camaraderie, the challenges ahead still looming but the small victory giving you all a renewed sense of purpose.)_

### Scene: Dinner Reflection and Strategy

_(The family sits around the dinner table, plates piled high with hearty food. The air is warm with the smell of roasted chicken and fresh-baked rolls. For the first time in a while, the tension has eased slightly, replaced by a sense of accomplishment.)_

**Joseph:** _(grinning as he passes the mashed potatoes)_  
"Gotta say, I’m proud of what we pulled off today. That field looked endless this morning, but we got it done."

**Father:** _(gruff but with a rare smile)_  
"You did alright. That harvester held up better than I thought it would."

**Player:** _(raising a glass of water)_  
"Here’s to Joseph’s hard work—and to all of us for making it through without too many hiccups."

_(The family clinks their glasses together. The mood is lighter, though the challenges ahead linger in the background.)_

**Mom:** _(smiling as she starts serving dessert)_  
"It’s nice to see you all working together. I don’t remember the last time we had a day like this."

**Julie:** _(leaning forward eagerly)_  
"Speaking of working together, I saw something at the farmer’s market last weekend. Mrs. Carter—you know, from the Co-Op—was there with her daughter. They were selling some kind of... ‘specialty canola oil.’ Said it was a ‘new premium blend.’"

**Player:** _(pausing mid-bite, curious)_  
"A premium blend? What’s so special about it?"

**Julie:** _(shrugging)_  
"I don’t know, but it was expensive. Way more than what most people around here would pay. The weird thing was, they didn’t look too happy about being there. Mrs. Carter was all smiles, but her daughter looked... I don’t know, stressed? Like she didn’t want to be there."

**Father:** _(scowling)_  
"Probably another one of the Co-Op’s schemes to squeeze money out of folks. They’ve got their hands in everything these days."

**Mom:** _(adding gently)_  
"Maybe it’s worth looking into. If they’re pushing something new, it might explain some of the things we’ve been seeing lately—like that strange taste in their flour."

**Player:** _(nodding, thoughtful)_  
"Good point. I’ll ask my friend to dig into it when he looks at the Co-Op’s practices. Something about this doesn’t sit right."

**Joseph:** _(half-joking)_  
"Careful. You start poking around, and Mrs. Carter might come after you with one of her ‘premium blends.’"

**Julie:** _(laughing)_  
"Well, if she does, you better watch out. I hear she’s got a mean swing with a spatula."

_(The table bursts into laughter, easing the tension for a moment. As the laughter dies down, the conversation shifts to planning.)_

**Player:** _(serious again)_  
"Alright, so what’s the next step? The wheat’s harvested, but we still have a long way to go."

**Father:** _(nodding)_  
"First, we need to figure out storage. The old grain bins need checking. Then there’s the equipment—we’ve got to decide what’s worth fixing and what needs replacing."

**Mom:** _(adding with a firm tone)_  
"And you need to make time to rest. You won’t fix this farm if you all run yourselves into the ground."

**Player:** _(smiling slightly)_  
"Yes, ma’am. But tomorrow, we hit the ground running. Let’s make a list tonight so we’re ready to go."

_(The family nods, the sense of unity and purpose growing as the meal continues. The challenges are still daunting, but for the first time in a while, hope is on the table alongside the food.)_

### Scene: A Day in Town

_(The morning sun filters through the windows as you finish your coffee, readying yourself for a day away from the farm. Your father and Joseph are already outside, inspecting the silo and planning their work. Your mom steps into the kitchen, pulling on her cardigan, and Julie trails behind, notebook in hand.)_

**Mom:** _(cheerfully)_  
"Alright, you ready for a day in town? We’ve got a lot of people to see and places to stop by."

**Player:** _(grabbing your keys)_  
"Let’s do it. It’ll be good to get a feel for what’s going on around here."

_(The three of you pile into the truck, Julie hopping into the backseat with her notebook. As you drive into town, the conversation flows easily.)_

**Mom:** _(pointing out landmarks as you pass)_  
"That used to be the old feed store. Closed down a few years ago—couldn’t keep up with the Co-Op’s prices. And over there, that’s where the farmers used to meet to trade equipment. It’s mostly empty now."

**Player:** _(frowning slightly)_  
"Sounds like the Co-Op’s made it tough for anyone not in their pocket."

**Mom:** _(nodding)_  
"You have no idea. They’ve got their hands in everything these days. But some folks still try to make it work. You’ll see when we get to the farmer’s market."

### At the Farmer’s Market

_(The market is bustling, stalls filled with fresh produce, handmade goods, and local crafts. You walk alongside your mom and Julie, taking in the sights and sounds. People greet your mom warmly, clearly happy to see her. Julie, meanwhile, seems more focused, scribbling in her notebook as she observes.)_

**Player:** _(curious)_  
"Julie, what are you writing in there?"

**Julie:** _(shrugging casually)_  
"Just notes. Stuff for the school paper."

**Mom:** _(smiling proudly)_  
"She’s the editor, you know. And she’s been working on something big."

**Player:** _(raising an eyebrow)_  
"Something big? Like what?"

**Julie:** _(hesitating, then leaning in conspiratorially)_  
"The Co-Op. I’ve been looking into their practices for weeks—how they undercut local farmers, push their own products, and control the market. Did you know they force members to buy seeds and supplies from them at inflated prices?"

**Player:** _(impressed)_  
"That’s... pretty heavy stuff for a 14-year-old."

**Julie:** _(grinning)_  
"Well, I’m not just any 14-year-old. Besides, someone’s got to dig into this. People deserve to know the truth."

**Mom:** _(adding quietly)_  
"She’s bright, that one. And she’s not wrong. The Co-Op’s been putting a stranglehold on this town for years. But they’re careful—they’ve got enough people in their corner to keep things quiet."

**Player:** _(thoughtful)_  
"Sounds like they’ve got a lot to answer for. Maybe we can use some of that research to push back."

**Julie:** _(excitedly)_  
"I can show you my notes later! There’s a lot in here—interviews with farmers, price comparisons, even some old contracts."

**Player:** _(smiling)_  
"I’d like that. Keep up the good work, Julie."

_(The conversation lingers as you browse the market, meeting old family friends and hearing their stories. Each interaction paints a clearer picture of the Co-Op’s dominance and the challenges facing the town.)_

### Wrapping Up the Day

_(As the afternoon winds down, you load a few purchases into the truck—fresh produce, some homemade jam from a neighbor, and a loaf of bread from a local baker.)_

**Mom:** _(settling into the passenger seat)_  
"Well, that was a productive day. Nice to see some familiar faces, wasn’t it?"

**Player:** _(nodding)_  
"Yeah. And it’s good to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with. Between what you’ve told me and what Julie’s dug up, I think we’re starting to piece things together."

**Julie:** _(from the backseat, flipping through her notebook)_  
"Just wait until you see the rest of my notes. We’ve barely scratched the surface."

_(The truck rumbles back toward the farm as the sun dips lower in the sky. The day’s conversations echo in your mind, a mix of determination and unease settling over you. The fight ahead is clearer now, but so are the stakes.)_

### Scene: Julie’s Investigation Wall

_(Later that evening, after dinner, Julie invites you upstairs to take a look at her research. You follow her into her room, and the sight stops you in your tracks. One wall is completely covered with a sprawling map of the town, adorned with push pins, strings, and sticky notes connecting various locations, names, and events. The room feels like a scene out of a conspiracy thriller.)_

**Player:** _(raising an eyebrow)_  
"Julie, what is all this? You look like you’re one step away from building a secret bunker."

**Julie:** _(grinning, unbothered by the remark)_  
"It’s my research! If you’re going to investigate something big, you need to keep it all organized."

**Player:** _(walking closer, examining the chaotic yet precise web of information)_  
"Organized? This looks like you’re planning to uncover a government cover-up. You’re fourteen, not a spy."

**Julie:** _(shrugging, crossing her arms)_  
"Age doesn’t matter when you’re chasing the truth. Besides, you’ll see why I had to set it up like this. There’s way too much going on for just one notebook."

_(She gestures to her desk, which is stacked with notebooks, some open and overflowing with scribbled notes, clipped newspaper articles, and printed emails.)_

**Player:** _(picking up one of the notebooks)_  
"Let me guess, this one’s about the Co-Op?"

**Julie:** _(nodding)_  
"That’s just the start. Each notebook covers a different angle—pricing schemes, seed contracts, supply chain manipulation, farmer testimonies... and this one..." _(she grabs a thick, well-worn notebook labeled “The Chairman”)_  
"...this one is about the head of the Co-Op. Or at least, what I think is going on."

**Player:** _(reading the label and frowning)_  
"The Chairman? Why no name?"

**Julie:** _(leaning closer to the map, pointing at a cluster of connected strings)_  
"Because I don’t think it’s a single person. I’ve been digging, and everything points to ‘The Chairman’ being more of a corporate identity. Whoever’s pulling the strings hides behind that title, making it impossible to figure out who’s really in charge."

**Player:** _(skeptical)_  
"That’s a big claim. What makes you think it’s not just one person?"

**Julie:** _(flipping open the notebook and pointing to highlighted sections)_  
"Look at these meeting records. Sometimes ‘The Chairman’ signs off on things that happen hours apart in completely different locations. And these interviews with former Co-Op employees—they all say the same thing: no one ever sees ‘The Chairman’ directly. It’s always emails, memos, or secondhand messages."

**Player:** _(nodding slowly, starting to see her point)_  
"Okay, that’s... actually impressive. How did you get these interviews? Some of this stuff is way too detailed for a school project."

**Julie:** _(grinning mischievously)_  
"Let’s just say I know how to ask the right questions. And people like to talk when they’re mad."

**Player:** _(laughing lightly)_  
"You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. So what’s your theory? If ‘The Chairman’ isn’t a person, what is it?"

**Julie:** _(serious now, her tone lowering)_  
"I think it’s a board of directors or some kind of corporate group. The Co-Op’s too big to be run by just one person, but they want it to seem like it is. Keeps the farmers intimidated, makes them think there’s one all-powerful boss they can’t fight."

**Player:** _(nodding, impressed by her logic)_  
"That’s... honestly brilliant. And terrifying."

**Julie:** _(smiling proudly)_  
"That’s why I need help. You’ve got the connections and the experience to dig deeper than I can. If we figure out who or what ‘The Chairman’ really is, we might be able to take them down."

**Player:** _(after a long pause, looking back at the map)_  
"Alright, Julie. Let’s see where this rabbit hole leads. But first, let’s get all this organized so I don’t feel like I’m in a detective movie every time I walk in here."

**Julie:** _(laughing)_  
"Deal. But don’t knock the strings—they’re color-coded for a reason."

_(The two of you dive into the notes, Julie explaining her findings in detail while you sift through the evidence. The wall of pins and strings starts to make a little more sense as the night goes on, and so does the daunting fight ahead.)_

### Scene: The Next Morning’s Breakfast

_(The morning light filters into the kitchen as you shuffle in, bleary-eyed and exhausted. The smell of coffee and frying bacon is enough to keep you moving. Julie, on the other hand, is already at the table, notebook in hand, her energy levels frustratingly high for someone who stayed up as late as you did.)_

**Julie:** _(cheerfully, between bites of toast)_  
"Morning! Big day ahead. I’ve got a list of people to talk to at the farmer’s market. Should be a productive morning."

**Player:** _(groaning as you pour yourself a cup of coffee)_  
"How are you even awake right now? We didn’t finish until, what, two in the morning?"

**Julie:** _(shrugging, grinning)_  
"I’m used to it. Plus, this stuff is too important to wait around for. I’ve got questions about the seed yields, pricing, and how things have changed since the Co-Op took over."

**Mom:** _(placing a plate of eggs in front of you)_  
"She’s been buzzing about it all morning. I told her to be careful, though. Not everyone will be thrilled to talk about the Co-Op."

**Player:** _(nodding, sipping coffee)_  
"Mom’s right. Even the non-Co-Op members still have to deal with them in some way. Be smart about how you approach it."

**Julie:** _(with determination)_  
"I know. I’ll stick to the ones I’ve talked to before—the ones who trust me. I’m not planning to stir up trouble. Yet."

**Father:** _(entering the kitchen, wiping his hands on a rag)_  
"Just don’t get too comfortable. Some of those farmers might be friendly, but they’re still under the Co-Op’s thumb. You don’t want word getting back to the wrong people."

**Julie:** _(rolling her eyes but nodding)_  
"Got it, Dad. I’ll keep my ears open and my mouth shut."

**Joseph:** _(joining the table, grabbing a plate)_  
"Speaking of wrong people, watch out for old man Carter. He might act all friendly, but he’s one of the Co-Op’s biggest enforcers. And don’t even think about talking to his son—he’ll rat you out in a heartbeat."

**Julie:** _(scribbling notes in her notebook)_  
"Carter, no. Got it. Anyone else?"

**Joseph:** _(thinking for a moment)_  
"Maybe steer clear of the Simmons family, too. They’re not officially with the Co-Op, but they’re close enough that it doesn’t matter."

**Julie:** _(nodding, adding more notes)_  
"Alright. Thanks, guys. I’ll be careful."

**Player:** _(finishing your coffee, finally feeling somewhat awake)_  
"Just remember, you’re doing great work, but it’s dangerous work. If you run into any trouble, you get out of there fast and come find me or Dad. Understood?"

**Julie:** _(grinning, full of confidence)_  
"Understood. Don’t worry, big bro. I’ve got this."

**Player:** _(calling out to Julie as she gathers her things)_  
"Hey, be back around lunchtime, okay? We need to send as much information as we can over to Ben Hastings."

**Julie:** _(nodding eagerly)_  
"Got it! I’ll make sure I’m back."

**Player:** _(turning to your father)_  
"Dad, do we have any Co-Op paperwork or contracts? Anything that might help? I want to send those to Ben, too."

**Father:** _(pausing, thinking for a moment)_  
"Yeah, we’ve got some old contracts in the office. I’ll dig them out for you before lunch."

_(The conversation shifts to lighter topics as breakfast winds down, but the undercurrent of caution remains. Julie heads out soon after, her notebook tucked under her arm, ready to face the day. You can’t help but feel a mix of pride and concern as you watch her go.)_

### Scene: Planning the Day’s Work

_(After breakfast, you and your father step outside onto the porch. The cool morning air carries the faint smell of wheat stubble from yesterday’s harvest. The two of you stand in quiet reflection for a moment before starting to plan the day’s tasks.)_

**Player:**  
"Alright, we’ve got a lot to do. First thing for me is heading into the city. I need to get to the bank, start transferring funds, and sell off some of my other holdings. It’s going to take most of the morning."

**Father:** _(nodding thoughtfully)_  
"Makes sense. While you’re doing that, I’ll get started on baling the straw from yesterday. It should bring in a little extra cash once I sell it to the animal dealer."

**Player:** _(smiling slightly)_  
"Sounds like a good plan. Anything else on your list?"

**Father:** _(thinking for a moment)_  
"If there’s time, I’ll start plowing that field and prepping it for planting tomorrow. We agreed on making it a grass field, right? Faster turnaround and multiple harvests a year should help steady the income."

**Player:** _(nodding)_  
"Yeah, grass is the way to go for now. And we’re holding onto the wheat until prices improve, right?"

**Father:**  
"That’s the plan. No sense selling it now if we can store it for a better payout later."

_(The two of you exchange a look of quiet determination. The tasks ahead are clear, but the challenges remain daunting.)_

**Player:**  
"Alright. I’ll check in with you when I get back. Let’s see how much we can knock out today."

**Father:** _(smiling faintly, his tone lightening)_  
"Don’t worry about me. Just make sure you don’t let those city bankers fleece you."

**Player:** _(laughing)_  
"I think I can handle myself."

_(With a nod, the two of you part ways to start your respective tasks. As you drive off toward the city, you see your father heading toward the barn, toolbox in hand, ready to tackle the work ahead. The day is just beginning, but every step feels like progress in the fight to save the farm.)_

### Scene: The Drive to the City

_(The morning sun glints off the windshield as you drive toward the city. The hum of the truck engine mixes with the chatter of the local news radio station playing in the background. You lean back in the seat, sipping a coffee you grabbed on the way out, letting your mind drift to the tasks ahead.)_

**Radio Host:** _(cheerfully)_  
"Coming up after the break, our field reporter has an exclusive interview with a local girl who has some _really_ big news! Stay tuned for that."

_(You roll your eyes, chuckling to yourself.)_

**Player:** _(thinking aloud)_  
"Big news? Probably someone bragging about their giant pumpkin."

_(The commercial break drones on, and you focus back on the road. Eventually, the break ends, and the radio crackles back to life.)_

**Radio Host:** _(enthusiastically)_  
"Welcome back, everyone! Now let’s turn it over to our field reporter with some interesting information about the Co-Op."

**Field Reporter:** _(confidently)_  
"Hey, thanks, Dan. I’m here with our local Junior Action Investigator, who has uncovered some shocking details about the Co-Op’s practices."

_(You grip the steering wheel tightly, a sinking feeling forming in your gut.)_

**Player:** _(muttering, panicked)_  
"Don’t say Julie Spell. Don’t say Julie Spell. For the love of everything, _don’t_ be her."

**Field Reporter:** _(with excitement)_  
"Junior Action Investigator Julie Spell!"

_(You nearly spill your coffee, your mind racing.)_

**Player:** _(yelling at the radio)_  
"Julie, what the hell are you doing?!"

**Julie:** _(calm and articulate, her voice strong through the radio)_  
"Thanks, Tom. I’ve been investigating the Co-Op for months now, and it’s clear they’ve been engaging in some highly questionable practices. From price manipulation to forcing farmers into unfair contracts, they’ve built a system that benefits only themselves while hurting the community."

_(You can feel your heart rate climbing as she continues, divulging more than you ever expected her to say.)_

**Julie:**  
"And that’s not all. Two years ago, Manny Lewis disappeared under mysterious circumstances after clashing with the Co-Op over their seed policies. I believe the Co-Op knows more about his disappearance than they’re letting on."

**Player:** _(shouting at the radio, panicked)_  
"Julie, stop! You can’t just say that on the air!"

**Field Reporter:** _(clearly intrigued)_  
"That’s a bold claim, Julie. Do you have evidence to back it up?"

**Julie:** _(without hesitation)_  
"I have interviews, documents, and data that paint a very clear picture. The Co-Op’s influence stretches far beyond what people realize."

_(Your mind races as you hear her words. You know she’s smart, but this is way more dangerous than anything you expected. The rest of the interview fades into the background as you try to figure out what to do next.)_

**Player:** _(muttering to yourself, gripping the wheel tightly)_  
"Julie, you’ve got no idea what kind of trouble you’ve just stirred up."

_(You press harder on the gas, the city looming in the distance, but your thoughts are consumed by what you’ve just heard. The stakes have just been raised, and you can only hope you’re ready for what comes next.)_

### Scene: The Call to the Lawyer

_(The city fades into the rearview mirror as you drive back toward the farm. The weight of the morning’s events sits heavy on your mind. Deciding it’s better to address the situation head-on, you pick up your phone and hit the speed dial for Ben Hastings, your lawyer friend. The phone rings twice before he picks up.)_

**Ben:** _(cheerfully)_  
"Hey there! How’s my favorite troublemaker doing?"

**Player:** _(groaning slightly)_  
"You’re not going to believe the kind of trouble I’ve got for you this time, Ben."

**Ben:** _(laughing lightly)_  
"Try me. I’ve heard it all. What’s up?"

**Player:** _(taking a deep breath)_  
"It’s about the Co-Op. I’ve been digging into their practices—contracts, pricing, all of it. My sister, Julie, has been investigating too. She’s got notebooks full of interviews, data, and evidence. It’s impressive, but there’s a problem."

**Ben:** _(curious)_  
"What kind of problem?"

**Player:** _(hesitating for a moment, then diving in)_  
"She went on live radio this morning. Called them out for shady practices, price manipulation, and even accused them of being behind Manny Lewis’ disappearance two years ago."

**Ben:** _(pausing, then whistling low)_  
"Wow. That’s... bold. And incredibly risky."

**Player:** _(nodding, even though he can’t see you)_  
"Tell me about it. She’s only fourteen, Ben, and now she’s put herself and the rest of us on the Co-Op’s radar."

**Ben:** _(serious now)_  
"Alright, first things first. Do you have any evidence to back up what she said? Because if they come after her for defamation, we’ll need to be ready."

**Player:**  
"Yeah, she’s got a ton of it. Contracts, pricing data, testimonies from farmers. She’s even got a whole notebook dedicated to someone called ‘The Chairman.’ She thinks it’s not a single person but some kind of corporate entity."

**Ben:** _(intrigued)_  
"That’s interesting. If she’s right, it could be a game-changer. But we need to tread carefully. The Co-Op won’t take this lying down."

**Player:**  
"I figured as much. That’s why I’m calling. I want to send you everything we’ve got. Contracts, her notes, everything. Can you start digging into it and see what kind of legal action we can take?"

**Ben:** _(confidently)_  
"Absolutely. Send it all over. I’ll start piecing it together and see if there’s enough to go on. But you need to keep a close eye on your sister. She’s brave, but she’s playing with fire here."

**Player:** _(sighing)_  
"Trust me, I know. I told her to be back by lunch so we can go over everything together and send it your way. I’m trying to keep her safe, but she’s... determined."

**Ben:** _(chuckling softly)_  
"Sounds like she takes after her big brother. Just keep me updated, and I’ll do everything I can on my end."

**Player:** _(relieved)_  
"Thanks, Ben. I knew I could count on you."

**Ben:**  
"Always. Hang in there, alright? We’ll figure this out."

_(You end the call, feeling a mix of relief and apprehension. The farm comes into view in the distance, and you know the fight against the Co-Op is only just beginning.)_

### Season Opening Dialogue

_(The scene opens with a sweeping aerial view of the family farm. The sun rises over the golden wheat fields, casting long shadows across the barn and farmhouse. The camera pans down to show you standing by the fence, hands in your pockets, staring out over the land that has seen better days. Your voice narrates over the scene.)_

**Narration:**
"They say you can always come home, but they never tell you what you’ll find when you get there. For me, it wasn’t just a place—it was a legacy. A legacy built by my grandfather’s hands, held together by my father’s grit, and now... barely hanging on by a thread."

_(The camera cuts to shots of the rundown equipment, the faded red barn, and the overgrown fields. Each image tells the story of a once-thriving farm now struggling to survive.)_

**Narration:**
"When I got the call, I thought I was coming back to lend a hand for a weekend—help harvest a field, maybe fix a tractor or two. What I found was a mountain of debt, broken equipment, and a family being crushed under the weight of a so-called Co-Op that seems more interested in control than community."

_(The scene shifts to moments from the past few days: your father working under a rusty tractor, Julie’s investigation wall covered in pins and string, and the harvester cutting through the wheat field.)_

**Narration:**
"This season isn’t just about saving a farm. It’s about fighting back—against the odds, against a system that’s stacked against us, and against those who think they can take what’s ours without a fight."

_(The camera zooms in on you as you turn toward the house, determination etched on your face. The screen fades to black with the words "The Rise of the Canola King" appearing in bold letters.)_

**Narration:**
"This is where it begins. Welcome to Dagger Spell Farms."

### Expanded Opening Scene: "The Call Back Home"

_(The screen fades from black to an aerial shot of Riverbend Springs, Arkansas, bathed in the warm hues of an early morning sunrise. Mist clings to the fields, and the faint hum of life begins as the camera pans across small farms, dusty roads, and the sleepy town. The shot lingers on the Spell family farm. The barn’s once-vibrant red paint is now peeling, and the grass around the yard is overgrown. The camera slowly zooms out to reveal the full extent of the farm’s decline, setting a somber tone. Cut to a bustling cityscape.)_

_(Inside a high-rise office building, the camera focuses on a man in his late 20s, standing by a large window. He wears a tailored suit, the picture of corporate success, yet his expression is distant as he gazes out over the sprawling urban skyline. On his desk, a phone vibrates softly. He glances at it before answering.)_

**Player:** _(hesitant)_\
"Hello?"

**Maggie (on phone):** _(voice trembling slightly)_\
"Honey, it’s me. I hate to call you at work, but... it’s your dad. The farm… it’s bad. Really bad. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t serious. Can you come home? Just for the weekend?"

**Player:** _(leaning back in his chair, rubbing his temple)_\
"Mom, I’m in the middle of a big deal. It’s not a good time."

**Maggie:** _(interrupting, her tone firm)_\
"This isn’t about deals. It’s about your family. Your dad’s too proud to say it, but he needs you. We all do."

_(The player’s brows furrow as he glances at the calendar on his desk. Before he can respond, a muffled voice is heard in the background of Maggie’s end of the call.)_

**Julie (background):**\
"Mom, who are you talking to? Is it him? What did he say?"

**Maggie:** _(snapping suddenly)_\
"Julie, not now! Go to your room."

_(The player freezes, startled. He has never heard his mother’s voice like this before—sharp, almost angry. There is silence on the line before Maggie exhales deeply, her tone softening.)_

**Maggie:**\
"I’m sorry, sweetheart. Things have just been... hard. Your dad’s not well, and the farm’s falling apart. I’m at my wits’ end."

**Player:** _(quietly, overwhelmed)_\
"Mom... I didn’t know it was this bad."

**Maggie:** _(gently)_\
"We’ll be alright. But I need you to come. Just for a little while."

_(A long pause. The player rubs the back of his neck, his expression conflicted. Finally, he sighs.)_

**Player:** _(resigned)_\
"Alright. Just for the weekend. I’ll drive down tomorrow."

**Maggie:** _(with relief)_\
"Thank you, sweetheart. You have no idea how much this means."

_(The call ends. The player stares at the phone for a moment before putting it down. He walks back to the window, gazing out as the voiceover begins.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**\
"They say you can always come home, but they never tell you how it feels to walk back into the past. For me, home was a place I swore I’d never return to. But some calls can’t be ignored."

_(The player walks back to his desk, picks up the desk phone, and dials a number. After a brief pause, his secretary answers.)_

**Secretary (on phone):**\
"Yes, sir?"

**Player:**\
"Push all my meetings for today and tomorrow to Monday. I have a family emergency to deal with."

**Secretary:**\
"Understood. I’ll reschedule everything. Is there anything else you need?"

**Player:**\
"No, that’s all. Thanks."

_(He hangs up the phone, exhales deeply, and walks back to the window, gazing out as the voiceover continues.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**\
"They never tell you how hard it is to face the memories you left behind. For me, going back wasn’t just about the farm; it was about everything I thought I’d left in the past. Some calls change everything in just a moment."

_(The screen fades to black as the faint sound of a car engine starting plays in the background, leading into the next scene.))_

### Scene Two: The Drive Back to Riverbend Springs

_(The screen fades in from black to a wide shot of a long, empty highway cutting through rural Arkansas. The landscape is dotted with rolling fields and clusters of trees. The camera pans to a high-end luxury sedan cruising down the road, with the faint sound of the wind and occasional birdsong.)_

_(Inside the luxury sedan, the player grips the steering wheel. The interior is pristine and refined, with a sleek travel mug and a small stack of neatly organized papers sitting on the passenger seat. The player’s face shows a mix of weariness and nervous anticipation. As the truck rolls on, the voiceover begins.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**
"It’s been years since I’ve driven this road. The last time, I wasn’t looking back. Now, every mile feels heavier."

_(The camera shifts to the rearview mirror, where hazy flashbacks begin to play. The first is of a younger version of the player walking through a wheat field with their grandfather. The scene is warm, golden, and idyllic.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**
"I spent most of my childhood with Grandpa, learning the land, the crops, and the life. He always said this farm wasn’t just dirt and buildings—it was roots. Our roots."

_(The flashback shifts to the grandfather teaching the player to drive an old tractor, both of them laughing as the machine lurches forward. The memory fades into another, this time of the player as a teenager helping with harvest, the sun setting in the background.)_

_(Another flashback begins, this time in the farmhouse kitchen. The grandfather sits across from the player, a serious yet proud expression on his face. A college acceptance letter lies on the table between them.)_

**Grandfather (Flashback):**
"You’ve got something special, kid. This farm’s in your blood, but you’ve got the mind to take it further. Go to college. Learn everything you can. One day, this place is going to need someone who understands both the land and the market."

_(The player, younger and uncertain, nods slowly as the grandfather places a firm hand on their shoulder.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**
"He believed in me more than anyone ever had. When he sent me off to college, I didn’t realize just how much weight those words would carry."\*

**Voiceover (Player):**
"He believed in this place, in what it could be. And for a while, I did too. But things changed."

_(The flashback darkens. The camera shows the player and their father in a heated argument in the barn. The grandfather’s absence is palpable.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**
"Grandpa always said the farm would bring us together. But after he passed, it only drove us apart."

_(The flashback shows the player packing a duffel bag, their father standing nearby, arms crossed, frustration etched on his face. The scene crescendos as the player yells their final words before storming out.)_

**Player (Flashback):**
"When you lose everything, don’t come crying to me to save you!"

_(The sound of the sedan’s tires on the highway pulls the player back to the present. They grip the steering wheel tighter, their expression hardening.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**
"I thought leaving would make it easier. It didn’t. Now I’m going back to a place that hasn’t felt like home in years."

_(The camera pans out to a wide shot of the sedan as it disappears over a hill, the farmland stretching endlessly under a blue sky. The screen transitions to the next scene.)_

### Scene Three: Arrival at the Farm

_(The scene opens with the luxury sedan turning off the main highway onto a narrow gravel road. Dust kicks up behind the car as it approaches the Spell family farm. The camera captures the first glimpses of the property: overgrown grass, rusting equipment scattered in the yard, and the barn’s faded red paint barely clinging to its weathered boards.)_

_(The sedan pulls to a stop near the farmhouse. The player steps out, adjusting their jacket and taking a long, measured look around. The expression on their face shifts between nostalgia and disbelief. The sound of tools clanging draws their attention to the barn, where their father, Bob, is working under an ancient tractor.)_

**Player:** _(calling out)_\
"Hey, old man! Still spending more time under the tractor than on it?"

_(Bob slides out from under the tractor, wiping his greasy hands on a rag. His face is lined with years of hard work and frustration, but there’s a flicker of surprise at seeing his eldest child standing there.)_

**Bob:**\
"Careful you don't get dirt on your fancy suit!"

**Player:** _(walking closer)_\
"Nothing fancy about this suit, it's made to be worked in just like your overalls"

_(Bob grunts, clearly uncomfortable with the situation. Before either can say more, the farmhouse door opens, and Maggie steps out onto the porch, drying her hands on a towel. Her face lights up, though her worry isn’t entirely hidden.)_

**Maggie:** _(warmly)_\
"You made it. Dinner’s at seven. Don’t make me come out here to drag you both in!"

_(The player smirks faintly, and Bob chuckles under his breath. There’s a brief, almost imperceptible moment of understanding between father and child.)_

_(As Maggie heads back inside, the player walks closer to the tractor, glancing at the tools scattered around.)_

**Player:**\
"What’s wrong with it?"

**Bob:** _(gruffly)_\
"Transmission’s shot. Like most everything else around here."

**Player:** _(sarcastic)_\
"Sounds about right."

_(Bob gives the player a sidelong glance but says nothing. The silence between them is heavy but not hostile. The player glances around the yard, taking in the state of disrepair.)_

**Player:** _(softly)_\
"It didn’t used to look like this."

**Bob:** _(without looking up)_\
"Yeah, almost a decade will do that!"

_(The player exhales and steps away, walking toward the barn. The camera follows, capturing glimpses of rusting equipment and weathered tools. The sense of neglect is almost tangible.)_

_(As the sun dips lower on the horizon, the player pauses at the edge of the barn, looking out over the fields. The golden light catches the overgrown grass and the distant treeline. The voiceover begins.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**\
"This place used to feel endless, full of possibilities. Now, it just feels... tired."

_(The camera pans out to show the player standing in silhouette against the backdrop of the farm. The sound of crickets begins to rise as the scene transitions to the next.)_

### Scene Four: Dinner at the Spell Household

_(The screen transitions to the interior of the farmhouse kitchen. The table is set with hearty dishes: roast chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, and freshly baked rolls. The warm light from an overhead lamp bathes the room in a cozy glow, creating an atmosphere that is both familiar and slightly strained as the family sits down to eat.)_

_(The player sits across from their father, Bob, while Maggie bustles around, placing the last dish on the table. Joseph leans back in his chair, stretching, and Julie flips through a small notebook, scribbling notes absentmindedly.)_

**Maggie:** _(gently chiding)_  
"Julie, put that notebook away. We’re having dinner as a family."

**Julie:** _(rolling her eyes but complying)_  
"Alright, alright."

_(Everyone begins serving themselves in silence, the clinking of utensils the only sound. Finally, Maggie clears her throat.)_

**Maggie:**  
"So, tell us about your work. What’s it like in Dallas these days?"

**Player:** _(shrugging, between bites)_  
"Busy. Closed a couple of big deals last month. Kept me tied up for weeks, but they went through without a hitch."

**Joseph:** _(grinning)_  
"Big shot, huh? Bet your boss loves you."

**Player:** _(smirking)_  
"I am the boss."

_(Joseph laughs, while Bob just grunts, focusing on his plate. The moment passes as Maggie redirects the conversation.)_

**Maggie:** _(smiling)_  
"Julie, why don’t you tell your brother about the talent show?"

**Julie:** _(perking up)_  
"Oh, yeah! I sang ‘Fields of Gold’ and got a standing ovation. Even Principal Harris said it was the best performance he’s seen in years."

**Maggie:** _(beaming)_  
"We’re so proud of you, sweetheart."

_(Joseph chimes in, leaning back in his chair.)_

**Joseph:**  
"Yeah, she’s got pipes, that’s for sure. Me, I’m just out here driving trucks for the Co-Op when they need extra hands. Not as glamorous as singing."

**Player:** _(raising an eyebrow)_  
"The Co-Op?"

**Joseph:** _(shrugging)_  
"Yeah, it’s decent money. Nothing steady, though."

_(The player nods, filing the information away. Maggie senses the need to keep the mood light and steers the conversation.)_

**Maggie:**  
"Well, at least you’re both staying busy. Now, eat up before everything gets cold."

_(The conversation shifts to lighter topics, but the player’s attention drifts. Their eyes wander around the room, taking in the small signs of wear: chipped paint, frayed curtains, and a slight sag in the ceiling. The voiceover begins.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"It was the same table, the same dishes, even the same stories. But something had changed. The cracks weren’t just in the walls—they were in us. It wasn’t just the years that wore us down; it was the silence, the things left unsaid, and the weight of what we’d lost. Sitting there, surrounded by the laughter and familiar smells, I couldn’t help but wonder: could we still fix this, or was it already too late?"

_(The sound of laughter pulls the player back to the present as Julie finishes a story with an animated flourish.)_

**Julie:**  
"Then Jenny slipped and fell face first into the pig shit!"

_(Maggie and Bob immediately respond in unison.)_

**Maggie and Bob:**  
"Julie!"

**Julie:** _(innocently)_  
"Sorry, pig poop. Can I say poop at the table?"

**Maggie:** _(sighing)_  
"Maybe we don’t talk about that at the table at all."

**Joseph:** _(grinning mischievously)_  
"Yeah, Julie, some of us are trying to eat here."

_(The camera pans out slowly, capturing the family seemingly happy and laughing despite the underlying tensions. The scene fades to black.)_

### Scene Five: The Hard Truth

_(The screen transitions to the farmhouse living room. The player sits on an old, slightly worn couch, leaning forward with their elbows on their knees. Bob is in his recliner, a weathered notebook in his hands. Maggie sits nearby in a straight-backed chair, her hands folded in her lap, her expression a mixture of worry and exhaustion.)_

**Player:** _(breaking the silence)_  
"Alright. No more dodging. How bad is it, really?"

_(Bob sighs heavily, flipping open the notebook. He pulls out a stack of papers and hands them to the player. The camera focuses on the papers: overdue bills, loan statements, and foreclosure warnings.)_

**Bob:**  
"Bad enough. We’re ten million in debt. Payments are coming due next month, and we don’t have anything close to what we need."

_(The player flips through the papers, their brow furrowing deeper with each page.)_

**Player:** _(in disbelief)_  
"How did it get this bad?"

**Maggie:** _(quietly)_  
"It didn’t happen overnight. First, the yields started dropping. Then the equipment started failing. And when the Co-Op tightened its grip... well, it was hard to keep up."

**Player:** _(looking at Bob)_  
"And the Co-Op? What’s their part in this?"

**Bob:** _(gruffly)_  
"They control everything. The seeds, the buyers, the contracts. You play by their rules, or you don’t play at all. I thought I could manage it, but..."

**Maggie:** _(cutting in, her voice trembling)_  
"It’s not just the Co-Op. The loans we took out to replace the land we lost, the medical bills when your father got sick last year... it all added up."

_(The player leans back, running a hand through their hair. The weight of the situation is almost suffocating.)_

**Player:** _(softly)_  
"Why didn’t you call me sooner?"

**Bob:** _(his pride flaring up)_  
"What were you gonna do? Fix it all with a few phone calls? We’ve been scraping by. I didn’t need you coming in here with your big-city solutions and telling me how to run my farm."

**Player:** _(sharply)_  
"It’s not just _your_ farm, Dad. It’s the family’s farm. Grandpa built this for all of us, not just you."

_(Bob starts to respond, his voice rising, but Maggie quickly intervenes.)_

**Maggie:** _(calm but firm)_  
"Enough, both of you. This isn’t helping. We need to work together, not tear each other apart."

_(Her words cut through the tension. Both Bob and the player take a moment to collect themselves. Maggie’s steady voice lowers the heat of the argument.)_

**Maggie:** _(firmly, interrupting)_  
"Bob, stop. We’re past that now. We need help."

_(The player exhales deeply, nodding. They set the papers down on the coffee table and look at both parents.)_

**Player:**  
"Alright. First thing tomorrow, we sit down and go through everything. I’ll call some of my contacts, see what can be done legally and financially. But this isn’t going to be easy."

**Maggie:** _(grateful)_  
"Thank you."

_(Bob remains silent, his pride clearly bruised, but he doesn’t argue. The camera lingers on the three of them in the dimly lit room, the weight of the situation heavy in the air. The scene transitions to the next.)_

### Scene Six: The Barn Office

_(The screen transitions to the dimly lit interior of the barn. Dust particles float lazily in the air, caught in the pale light of a single hanging bulb. The camera pans over old tools, a cracked workbench, and a faded calendar from years ago. The player steps into the small office tucked into the corner of the barn, its door creaking slightly as it swings open.)_

_(Inside the office, the player scans the cluttered desk: stacks of papers, a rusting typewriter, and a weathered leather notebook lying atop the mess. The player picks up the notebook, running a hand over its cover before opening it. The voiceover begins.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"This was Grandpa’s domain. Every plan, every decision, it all started here. He always said a farm needs a captain, someone to steer the ship."

_(The camera focuses on the pages as the player flips through them. Neatly written notes detail crop rotations, equipment upgrades, and ambitious expansion plans for the next five years. The handwriting is confident and precise.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"He had big dreams for this place. More land, better equipment, a legacy to pass on. He believed in this farm... in us."

_(The player pauses on a page detailing ideas for increasing yields while remaining independent of external control, a subtle jab at the growing influence of the Co-Op.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"He saw it coming—the Co-Op, their control. He had plans to push back, to keep this place ours. So why didn’t Dad follow through?"

_(The player sets the notebook down, glancing around the room. Their eyes land on another notebook tucked under a stack of papers. This one has "Bob" written on the cover in faded ink. Curious, the player picks it up and begins to leaf through its contents.)_

_(The handwriting is messier, more hurried. The pages contain scattered ideas: new crops to try, repair schedules, and budget plans. Many entries are incomplete, with notes abruptly ending mid-thought. The further the player reads, the more chaotic the pages become.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"Dad tried. He had plans, too. But somewhere along the way, things started slipping."

_(The player turns another page, revealing entire entries scratched out, the words unreadable. Water droplet stains mar the paper, evidence of tears shed in frustration or despair.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"And then... he stopped."

_(The player closes the notebook gently, setting it back on the desk. They sit down heavily in the old office chair, staring at the mess of papers and tools surrounding them. The voiceover concludes.)_

**Voiceover (Player):**  
"At least he was trying."

_(The camera lingers on the player for a moment, the weight of the moment clear. The screen slowly fades to black, marking the end of the episode.)_

"Okay something to note it not something main to the story, but the reason it is called Dagger Spell Farms, is because my grandpa's nickname growing up was "Dagger" because of a birthmark in the shape of a dagger on his cheek that went away in childhood. I also had a similar birthmark on my chest, and my father had one on his ankle. This symbolizes the face, heart and ground of the farm. "

Scene: Morning at the Farmhouse Kitchen
The early light of dawn filters through the farmhouse kitchen window. The table is a controlled chaos of notebooks, legal pads, a laptop, and an old-fashioned ledger. A steaming coffee mug rests in your left hand, while your right hand alternates between typing on the laptop and jotting notes with a pencil. The quiet hum of the refrigerator and distant birdsong provide the soundtrack as you work, lost in thought.

The phone on the table buzzes, the 6:00 AM alarm vibrating faintly against the wood. You glance at it, swipe it off, and mutter to yourself.

Protagonist (to themselves):
“Guess old habits die hard.”

Your eyes drift back to the scattered papers, particularly the ones from your dad and grandpa. Scribbled notes fill the margins, and fine print sprawls across the bottom of several pages, barely legible.

Protagonist (to themselves, smirking):
“Looks like a lot of very little word mages wrote all over this mess. Grandpa would’ve thrown this in the fire and called it a day.”

You scroll through your contacts on your phone and land on ‘B.D. Hastings.’ With a smirk, you hit ‘Call Now.’ The phone rings twice before a familiar voice answers.

B.D. Hastings (with a grin in his voice):
“Well, if it isn’t my favorite number wizard. What’s the occasion? The markets are closed, and I know you’re not calling me just to reminisce about D&D campaigns.”

Protagonist (chuckling):
“Morning, Big Dog. I figured you’d be up already, probably casting your own brand of legal spells over breakfast.”

B.D.:
“You’re not wrong. Got my coffee, a pile of contracts, and a client who thinks fine print is a suggestion. So, what’s on your plate? And don’t tell me it’s pancakes—I’ll be jealous.”

Protagonist:
“Not pancakes. Coffee and a mess of old notes, contracts, and Co-Op paperwork that Grandpa left behind. I’m trying to make sense of it all, but let’s just say the word mages who wrote these didn’t make it easy. Grandpa was onto something, but I don’t have the whole picture.”

B.D. (interested):
“Co-Op, huh? Sounds like a lot of fun for a Sunday morning. What’s the angle? Pricing disputes, land rights, or just the usual ‘sign here and pray’ kind of deal?”

Protagonist:
“Could be all of the above. Dad’s notes are incomplete, and Grandpa’s are... well, Grandpa’s—cryptic and straight to the point. What I can piece together makes it look like the Co-Op’s been playing dirty, skimming off the top or worse. I need to know what my options are if I decide to push back.”

B.D. (with a laugh):
“So you called me to decipher the runes and find the loopholes? You’re lucky I’m up for a good legal puzzle.”

Protagonist:
“Yeah, well, you’ve got a knack for this stuff. And I figured it was about time I reminded you how much you owe me for carrying you through all those D&D campaigns in college.”

B.D. (grinning):
“Don’t flatter yourself. My bard kept us alive more times than I can count. Alright, number wizard, here’s the deal—send me scans of everything you’ve got. Contracts, Grandpa’s notes, the fine print, the whole shebang. I’ll dig into it and see what I can find.”

Protagonist:
“Thanks, Big Dog. I’ll get everything over to you within the hour. And hey—coffee’s on me next time I’m in Arkansas.”

B.D.:
“Make it coffee and lunch, and you’ve got yourself a deal. Oh, and one more thing—are you heading back to Dallas anytime soon, or are you finally trading the stock market for the soybean market?”

Protagonist (pausing):
“Let’s just say I’m still figuring that part out. One step at a time.”

B.D.:
“Fair enough. Alright, send me the papers. I’ll see what these word mages are hiding. Later.”

Protagonist:
“Later.”

The call ends. You sit back, take a long sip of coffee, and stare at the stack of papers. The camera lingers on your thoughtful expression as the scene fades out.

Scene: Kitchen – Morning Continues
The camera lingers on the protagonist at the kitchen table, shuffling through papers, muttering under their breath while jotting down notes. A faint creak from the floorboards announces someone entering the room. The protagonist glances up as their mom walks in, wearing a warm but knowing smile.

Mom (smiling):
“Well, now this takes me back.”

She gestures to the table, her gaze sweeping over the cluttered papers and laptop. There’s a nostalgic twinkle in her eyes.

Mom:
“You were like this every morning after high school—coffee in one hand, pencil in the other, turning Grandpa’s hieroglyphics into spreadsheets. Some things never change.”

Protagonist (smiling):
“Morning, Mom. I made coffee.”

In the background, the muffled voice of Dad echoes from another room.

Dad (grumbling, playful):
“It’s not that fancy city coffee, is it? What’s it called again? Frappacrappino?”

Mom chuckles, shaking her head, and the protagonist stifles a laugh.

Protagonist (smirking):
“No, Dad. Just regular coffee. I forgot to bring my fancy coffee maker with me.”

Mom walks over, standing behind the protagonist. She places a hand gently on their shoulder, leaning down to examine the chaos on the table. Her voice drops to a playful whisper.

Mom (teasing):
“So… are you planning to camp out here all day, or can I use my beautiful kitchen table to serve breakfast to this family?”

Protagonist (grinning sheepishly):
“Sorry, Mom. I’ll clean it up. Guess some habits are hard to break.”

Just then, the sound of footsteps thudding down the stairs fills the air. The protagonist’s younger brother, Robert, and sister, Julie, enter the kitchen. Julie rubs her eyes groggily, while Robert looks half-awake but alert enough to glance at the table.

Mom (brightly):
“Oh good, Robert, look—all the heathens are awake. Help your brother clear the table, you two.”

Julie (grinning sarcastically):
“But why? We didn’t make the mess. Besides, I need coffee before I deal with either of these two morons.”

She gestures lazily toward Robert and the protagonist, earning a snicker from Robert.

Mom (raising an eyebrow):
“Because you owe him for taking the blame when my favorite cutting board mysteriously broke.”

There’s a moment of stunned silence as the siblings exchange wide-eyed glances. Julie’s smirk fades as she looks at the protagonist.

Julie (caught off guard):
“You knew about that?”

Mom (matter-of-fact):
“Of course I did. But you two thought you were clever, and I was curious how long you’d keep the secret.”

The protagonist shakes their head, chuckling, while Julie looks at Robert, feigning indignation.

Julie (grinning):
“Well, I guess that means you owe me a cup of coffee, Robert.”

Robert (grinning back):
“Only if you make it yourself.”

Mom (clapping her hands lightly):
“Alright, that’s enough. Clear the table, or I’m withholding breakfast from all of you. Your dad will have pancakes and bacon ready in ten minutes.”

The siblings groan in unison but start gathering the papers, working together to move the clutter off the table. The camera pans to the protagonist, who watches the lively family interaction with a small, fond smile as the scene transitions.

Scene: Breakfast Table – Morning
The table is clear, except for coffee mugs and a few stray crumbs from breakfast. Julie and Mom finish wiping down the table, then sit down with their coffee. Dad leans back in his chair, his hands wrapped around his mug, watching the protagonist intently. Robert sits quietly, sipping his coffee, while Julie pulls out her ever-present notebook, opening it to a fresh page.

The atmosphere is calm, but there’s an undercurrent of tension as Dad finally speaks.

Dad (directly):
“So… how bad is it really? Meaning, how long do you think you’re going to have to suffer being back here?”

His tone is measured but laced with frustration, clearly reflecting his own unease about the situation. He glances briefly at Julie and Robert, then back to the protagonist.

Protagonist (hesitating):
“Do you really want to talk about this now? In front of everyone?”

Dad (firmly):
“They’re part of this family, aren’t they? They might as well hear it too.”

Mom looks at the protagonist and gives a subtle nod of encouragement. The protagonist takes a deep breath, deciding to dive in.

Protagonist:
“Alright. After going through the numbers, the total debt is just over 8.5 million.”

The room goes silent. Julie immediately starts scribbling in her notebook, her brow furrowed in concentration. Robert stiffens, his coffee mug halfway to his lips. Dad’s jaw tightens, but he doesn’t interrupt.

Protagonist (continuing):
“But it’s not as hopeless as it sounds. I can come up with that much, but if we pay it all off, we’re just back at zero. That’s not sustainable.”

Mom (leaning forward):
“So, what’s the plan?”

Protagonist:
“The best option is to pay off most of the loan and restructure the rest. That way, we have some working capital to get through a couple of grow seasons and start building the farm back up. I think we should pay all but 500K of the loan.”

Dad narrows his eyes, leaning forward slightly.

Dad:
“And you can come up with that kind of money? Eight million? How?”

Protagonist (pausing):
“It means liquidating almost all of my personal assets. I’ll be starting over, but at least the farm will have a chance.”

Julie’s pencil moves quickly across the page, but no one acknowledges it. Robert frowns, looking between the protagonist and Dad.

Robert:
“Isn’t that… I don’t know… too much to risk? What if it doesn’t work?”

Protagonist:
“It’ll work. But we’ll need to tighten things up. That’s why I called B.D. this morning. He’s going to go over all the paperwork we have on the Co-Op and see if there’s anything we can use against them. Tomorrow, while I’m in Little Rock, I’ll also call some contacts about getting a lease line of credit for equipment.”

Dad (interrupting, skeptical):
“You better be careful. Some of the dealers around here work hand-in-hand with the Co-Op. They’ll bury you in fine print. Make sure you read every line twice—maybe three times.”

Protagonist (nodding):
“I know, Dad. And trust me, a Co-Op can’t legally force us to use specific suppliers. They can recommend, sure, but they can’t require it. I’ll be thorough.”

Dad (relaxing slightly):
“Good. But don’t think for a second that I’m just going to sit back and let you run the show. We’re going to do this my way. You’re here to help, not take over.”

Protagonist (firmly but respectfully):
“I understand. We’ll do it together.”

There’s a long pause as Dad studies the protagonist, then gives a small, approving nod. The tension eases slightly as Mom breaks the silence.

Mom (with a smile):
“Alright, now that that’s settled, what’s the first step?”

Protagonist:
“We need to go through the equipment and figure out what’s usable for the wheat harvest. After that, we’ll start prepping the fields for canola.”

Dad (nodding):
“Good. Wheat first, then canola. And you’d better know what you’re doing.”

Robert:
“Alright, but you’re not going to make me handle all the busted tractors alone, right?”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Nope. We’re in this together. Let’s get moving.”

As the family starts to stand, the camera lingers briefly on Julie. She’s still writing furiously in her notebook, completely absorbed. The protagonist notices but says nothing, filing it away for later. The camera follows the group as they leave the table, transitioning to the barn.

Scene: Barn and Equipment Yard – Morning to Afternoon

The camera opens with a wide shot of the barn and equipment yard, where the protagonist, Dad, and Robert are seen walking toward a row of aging tractors and combines. The sunlight shifts subtly throughout the scene, marking the passage of time. As they begin examining the equipment, the protagonist’s voiceover starts.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“When you grow up on a farm, you learn that everything has a job to do. Machines aren’t just machines—they’re lifelines. And out here, nothing gets thrown away unless it absolutely has to. That’s why Grandpa’s old equipment yard looks more like a museum of farming history than a working operation.”

The camera cuts to close-ups of dusty, rusting machinery. A tractor engine sputters as Robert tries to start it, shaking his head when it fails. Dad kneels by a combine, inspecting a broken belt, while the protagonist writes on a clipboard. The voiceover continues.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“Most of this stuff hasn’t run in years. Some of it probably hasn’t worked since I was a kid. But here we are, trying to piece together what’s salvageable and what’s not. Grandpa would’ve called it a waste of time, but he also would’ve been the first one out here with his wrench and grease gun.”

The scene speeds up, showing the three of them systematically moving from one machine to the next. They check oil levels, inspect tires, and test engines. Robert wipes sweat from his brow, while Dad gestures animatedly, explaining something about the combine’s mechanics.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“It’s tedious work—cataloging every broken part, every missing piece—but it’s the only way to figure out what we’re up against. If we don’t know what we need, we can’t plan for it. And right now, planning is the only thing keeping this farm afloat.”

The camera zooms in on a notebook, where the protagonist writes a list: “Replace: Combine belt, Tractor hydraulics, Seeder tines…” The handwriting is neat but hurried. Julie appears briefly in the background, notebook in hand, jotting something down as she watches the group work.

The timelapse continues, showing tools scattered across the ground, parts being inspected, and discussions between the three men. Occasionally, there are smiles and laughter, showing brief moments of levity amidst the hard work.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“By midday, we had a comprehensive list—a mix of repairs we could manage ourselves and equipment we’d need to lease or buy outright. The numbers weren’t pretty, and it was clear we might have to adjust the loan plan to make it work.”

The camera cuts to a shot of the three of them sitting on the tailgate of a truck, drinking water and looking over the list. Dad frowns, Robert looks concerned, and the protagonist seems deep in thought.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“This farm has always been about balance—between risk and reward, between hard work and patience. Now, it’s about balancing what we can afford with what we can’t afford to lose.”

The scene ends with a long shot of the equipment yard, bathed in late afternoon light. The group walks back toward the barn, silhouetted against the setting sun. The protagonist’s voiceover concludes.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“Fixing a farm isn’t just about the land or the crops—it’s about the people who make it all work. And for better or worse, we were in this together.”

Scene: Kitchen Table – Evening

The table is freshly cleared from dinner, save for a couple of coffee mugs and glasses of water. The family is gathered around, the atmosphere relaxed but focused. The protagonist sits at the head of the table with the equipment list spread out in front of them, Dad beside them, and Robert leaning back in his chair. Julie is seated across, her ever-present notebook open and her pencil poised, ready to jot down notes. The camera pans across the family as the conversation unfolds.

Protagonist (looking at the list):
“Alright, so here’s where we’re at. We’ll need belts for the combine, a hydraulic rebuild for the big tractor, and tines for the seeder. That’s the priority to get the wheat in. The rest can wait until after harvest.”

Julie’s pencil scratches lightly as she checks items off in her notebook. Mom sits nearby, sipping tea and listening quietly.

Dad (gruffly):
“That’s assuming those tines don’t snap the second you put the seeder in the ground. You’d better add a backup set to the list, just in case.”

Protagonist (nodding):
“Good call. Backup tines it is.”

Robert:
“And don’t forget the new hitch pin for the hay wagon. You know the one we rigged with duct tape? It’s probably a safety hazard waiting to happen.”

Protagonist (writing it down):
“Noted. Anything else?”

There’s a brief pause, then Julie clears her throat and looks up from her notebook.

Julie:
“Actually, yeah. You forgot about three minor parts for the grain trailer. The hydraulic coupler, the light bracket, and the tire valve cap. You know, the one that always leaks?”

The room goes quiet for a second as everyone looks at her. Dad raises an eyebrow, clearly impressed but trying not to show it. The protagonist blinks, then smiles.

Protagonist:
“Good catch, Julie. That’s some serious attention to detail.”

Julie (grinning):
“Somebody’s got to keep you guys on track.”

The protagonist leans back, studying her for a moment, then gestures toward her notebook.

Protagonist:
“Speaking of which, what’s the deal with that notebook? Everywhere we go, you’re writing in it. What are you working on?”

Julie’s grin turns into a full-blown smirk. She closes the notebook dramatically, tapping the cover with her pencil.

Julie:
“Oh, you mean this? This is the notebook. It’s got everything—notes on the Co-Op, the contracts, Grandpa’s ledgers, the equipment, even some old receipts I found in the barn. You’d be surprised what you can piece together when you actually pay attention.”

She flips it open again and starts flipping through the pages, her tone growing more animated.

Julie:
“For example, did you know the Co-Op adjusted their pricing model three years ago? Grandpa caught it—his notes show that the margin they’re skimming doubled overnight. Then there’s this bit about equipment dealers. Dad’s right—some of them are in the Co-Op’s pocket. I’ve got notes on which ones to avoid. Oh, and don’t even get me started on their fuel supplier contracts—those are a disaster.”

The family stares at her, surprised by the depth of her research. Mom’s eyes widen slightly, while Robert leans forward, clearly intrigued.

Robert:
“You figured all that out from just poking around?”

Julie (shrugging):
“Poking around and paying attention. Someone has to do it.”

The protagonist exchanges a glance with Dad, who nods subtly. They look back at Julie, a mix of pride and amusement in their expression.

Protagonist (with a smile):
“Alright, Sherlock. Looks like we’ve got ourselves an ace detective on the team. Keep it up—your notes might be the key to figuring all this out.”

Dad (gruff but approving):
“She’s got the family smarts, that’s for sure. Just don’t let it go to your head.”

Julie rolls her eyes but grins, clearly pleased with the acknowledgment. The camera lingers on the family, the mood lightening as they start to discuss the plan for the next day. The camera pans out slowly, showing Julie flipping through her notebook again while the others talk, the scene fading to quiet.

Scene: Kitchen – Morning, Shortly After Breakfast

The kitchen is warm and bustling with activity as the protagonist, Mom, and Julie clean up from breakfast. The clink of dishes and running water fills the air. The protagonist dries plates while Mom scrubs pans and Julie wipes down the counters, her ever-present notebook open on the corner of the table.

Protagonist (glancing at Julie’s notebook):
“So, about that notebook. You’ve been busy. When did all this research start?”

Julie (not looking up as she wipes):
“Honestly? A couple of years ago. Being the editor of the school newspaper has its perks—I get to ask questions, interview people, dig around without anyone thinking twice. It started with Grandpa’s notes, but once I realized how much the Co-Op was involved, I started talking to other farmers around here.”

Protagonist (surprised):
“Other farmers? You’ve been collecting info from the whole area?”

Julie (grinning):
“Yup. Grandpa wasn’t the only one who noticed things weren’t adding up. A lot of the small farms are struggling, and they all have stories—contracts that don’t make sense, pricing changes no one can explain, shady equipment deals. I’ve got receipts, notes, and even some old letters. It’s all in here.”

She gestures to her notebook, her expression a mix of pride and determination. The protagonist looks at her, clearly impressed.

Protagonist:
“Wow. I had no idea you were doing all this.”

Mom (smiling as she rinses a dish):
“She’s been at it for a while. I’ve seen her sitting up late, writing in that thing like her life depends on it.”

Julie (teasing):
“Somebody’s gotta keep this family in line.”

Protagonist (chuckling):
“Well, you’re doing a good job. But hey, I think we need to talk about all this in more detail. You’ve got way more information than I realized, and it could make a difference.”

Julie (raising an eyebrow):
“Talk when? You’ve got a million things to do, and I’ve got schoolwork piling up.”

Protagonist (leaning against the counter):
“Actually, I was thinking today. I’m heading to Little Rock to meet with some contacts about equipment and financing. Why don’t you come with me? We can talk on the way.”

Julie (hesitant):
“Little Rock? Sounds boring. You’re just going to be talking business all day.”

Protagonist:
“Sure, but you might learn something. Plus, I could use your input. You’ve got all this research, and I think you’d have a lot to add to the conversations.”

Julie (still unsure):
“I don’t know… I’ve got stuff to do here.”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Tell you what. If you come with me, I’ll buy you some new notebooks. And pens. Maybe even those fancy highlighters you like.”

Julie (pretending to think):
“Hmm. Notebooks, pens, and highlighters? That’s a tempting offer.”

Protagonist (teasing):
“Come on, nerd. You know you want to.”

Julie rolls her eyes but laughs, tossing her towel onto the counter as she grabs her notebook.

Julie:
“Fine. But you’re getting me the good notebooks—not the cheap ones.”

Protagonist (mock-serious):
“Done. Go get ready, and we’ll leave as soon as possible.”

Julie starts to walk out of the kitchen, notebook tucked under her arm, but Mom’s voice cuts through in a stern, no-nonsense tone.

Mom (firmly):
“Excuse me, young lady.”

Julie stops in her tracks, turning quickly, her expression sheepish.

Julie (immediately):
“Sorry, Mom.”

She walks back to the counter, picks up the towel she was using, folds it neatly, and places it back in its spot. Satisfied, Mom nods approvingly as Julie hurries out of the room.

Mom (smiling slightly):
“She might have your Grandpa’s brain, but she still needs reminding now and then.”

Protagonist (chuckling):
“Don’t we all.”

The scene ends with the protagonist drying the last dish, a thoughtful expression on their face as the camera fades to the next scene.

Scene: Road Trip to Little Rock – Late Morning to Midday

The scene opens with a wide shot of the protagonist’s truck pulling out of the driveway and heading down a rural road. The camera transitions to a series of time-lapse shots: the truck passing through small towns, winding along tree-lined highways, and stopping briefly at a gas station before continuing. Inside the cab, Julie and the protagonist are seen talking, laughing, and sharing lighthearted moments. The protagonist’s voiceover begins.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“The drive to Little Rock was exactly what I needed—a chance to actually catch up with Julie and get a better sense of everything she’s uncovered. For all her sass, she’s sharp. She’s pieced together more about the Co-Op’s dealings than I could’ve imagined.”

The camera cuts to a close-up of Julie flipping through her notebook, gesturing animatedly as she talks. The protagonist laughs at something she says, shaking their head in amused disbelief.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“Turns out, she’s been busy—interviewing farmers, digging through Grandpa’s old records, and cross-referencing it all with what she’s seen firsthand. She’s got notes on pricing structures that don’t make sense, contracts that seem designed to trap small farms, and even a few cases where equipment dealerships and suppliers are working hand-in-hand with the Co-Op to squeeze out the little guys.”

Another shot shows Julie pointing something out in her notebook, her tone animated, while the protagonist nods thoughtfully. They exchange a quick joke, both laughing, as the truck rolls on. The time-lapse continues with shots of the open highway, the occasional sign for Little Rock appearing in the distance.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“She’s not just collecting stories—she’s connecting the dots. And while she admits she doesn’t have all the answers, her instincts are spot on. She’s found patterns—little inconsistencies that, taken alone, might not mean much. But together? They tell a story. One that doesn’t paint the Co-Op in a very flattering light.”

The truck passes into the outskirts of Little Rock, where the scenery shifts to more urban landscapes. The camera lingers on a shot of the truck pulling into a large parking lot in front of a sleek bank building. As the engine shuts off, the voiceover fades, replaced by Julie’s voice.

Julie (serious but thoughtful):
“Now, having said all that, I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t know if any of it is illegal. I just know that it doesn’t feel right—if that makes sense.”

The protagonist looks over at her, pausing for a moment before nodding.

Protagonist (with a small smile):
“Yeah, it makes sense. Let’s see what we can do with it.”

The scene ends with the two of them stepping out of the truck, Julie clutching her notebook as they head toward the bank entrance. The camera lingers on the bank’s imposing façade before fading out.

Scene: Bank Office – Afternoon

The protagonist and Julie sit across from the Bank Manager, a neatly dressed man in his early 50s with a professional but friendly demeanor. Papers are spread across his desk, and a computer screen displays figures reflecting the results of the meeting. Julie’s notebook rests on her lap, and she’s quietly jotting notes as the conversation winds down.

Bank Manager (smiling):
“Well, it looks like the markets were kind to you last night. Once all your assets are liquidated, the total comes to just over ten million dollars. That’s quite a sum.”

The protagonist blinks in surprise, sitting back in their chair for a moment as the weight of the number sinks in. They glance at Julie, who pauses her writing to look up, equally stunned.

Protagonist (quietly, to themselves):
“Ten million...”

They let out a slow breath, gathering their thoughts, then turn back to the Bank Manager with a resolute nod.

Protagonist:
“Alright. In that case, I need to set up one more account.”

Bank Manager (leaning forward, curious):
“Of course. What kind of account are we talking about?”

Protagonist:
“A trust fund. I want to allocate one million dollars for my sister’s college education.”

Julie’s jaw drops, her pencil slipping from her hand. She looks at the protagonist, her eyes wide with disbelief.

Julie:
“Wait, what? Are you serious?”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Completely serious. You’ve earned it. Between all your research, your grades, and everything else you do, it’s the least I can do. You’ve got a bright future ahead of you, and I want to make sure you have every opportunity to chase it.”

Julie’s eyes glisten as she tries to hold back tears, but her smile breaks through as she takes a shaky breath.

Julie (half-laughing, half-sniffling):
“Thank you… really, thank you. But—”

Her tone shifts to playful as she wipes at her eyes with her sleeve.

Julie (grinning):
“You still owe me the notebooks and stuff you promised.”

The room erupts in laughter, even the Bank Manager chuckling as he finishes typing in the details for the trust fund.

Protagonist (laughing):
“Deal’s a deal. You’ll get your fancy notebooks, nerd.”

Bank Manager (smiling):
“Well, that’s a first. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone turn a million-dollar trust fund into a debate about office supplies.”

Julie grins, clearly touched but hiding it behind her usual sass. The Bank Manager hands the protagonist a document to sign, finalizing the setup of the trust fund. Julie looks at her older sibling with a mixture of admiration and gratitude, her notebook clutched tightly in her hands.

The scene ends with the protagonist signing the papers, their expression a mix of determination and satisfaction. The camera lingers on Julie’s smile, her emotions unspoken but evident, as the scene fades to the next chapter.

Scene: Inside the Car – Late Afternoon

The camera opens with a shot of the truck driving down a long, sunlit highway. Inside, the protagonist is behind the wheel, Julie is in the passenger seat, her notebook open on her lap as she writes. The faint hum of tires on the road fills the quiet until the protagonist picks up their phone and presses a button to call B.D. The phone rings twice before a familiar voice answers, loud and unfiltered.

B.D. (answering):
“Hey, what’s up, mother—”

Protagonist (cutting him off quickly):
“Hey, B.D., I’ve got my sister in the car. Be careful with the language.”

B.D. (faltering):
“Oh, shit—uh, sorry! Sorry! Julie, you heard nothing, right?”

Julie (without missing a beat):
“I heard you say shit!”

The protagonist chuckles, shaking their head as Julie smirks and makes a dramatic motion of jotting something in her notebook.

Protagonist:
“Yeah, and she probably made a note about it in her notebook. Listen, man, we all need to talk. Are you free for a long and winding road?”

B.D.:
“Yeah, but let me give you a quick detour first. Me and a couple of interns looked over all the tiny word mages’ writing you sent over. None of it’s illegal. Shady as hell? Absolutely. But illegal? No.”

Julie (confused):
“Tiny word mages?”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Oh, that’s just what we call the fine print lawyers who write all the legalese in contracts. They’re the tiny word mages casting spells to confuse you.”

Julie raises an eyebrow, intrigued but still skeptical.

Protagonist:
“Okay, you ready for a word dump to envy all other word dumps?”

B.D. (hesitant):
“Uh… sure? Go ahead, shoot.”

Protagonist:
“Alright, Julie. Let him have it.”

Julie sits up straighter, flipping through her notebook with dramatic flair before launching into an impassioned, rapid-fire rant. She recounts everything she’s uncovered—shady pricing schemes, farmers’ complaints, hidden clauses in contracts, and questionable practices tied to equipment dealers. The camera cuts between her animated gestures and the protagonist glancing over with a proud, amused smile.

When Julie finally finishes, there’s a brief silence on the other end of the line.

B.D. (stunned):
“Well, shit.”

Julie (mock-serious):
“That’s strike two.”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Careful, man. I think she plays by baseball rules, so you’ve only got one more.”

They all laugh, the tension easing slightly.

B.D. (recovering):
“Alright, jokes aside—Julie, are you looking for a job? I could use someone with that level of detail. Seriously though, some of what you said actually is illegal. Now, that’s going by your summary, so I’ll need to see your notes to confirm. Get me everything, and we’ll figure out if there’s enough to make a case.”

Protagonist:
“Got it. When we get back to the house, we’ll pull it all together and send it your way.”

Protagonist (continuing):
“Next question. Do you still have the dealer contacts from that DeVail case you worked on last year?”

B.D. (curious):
“Yeah, why? What do you need that for?”

Julie (jumping in):
“Well, duh, we’re going to need new equipment and shit, man.”

Without missing a beat, B.D. responds.

B.D.:
“That’s one.”

The car erupts in laughter, Julie shaking her head but clearly enjoying the banter. The camera cuts to a wide shot of the truck driving into the horizon, the sound of their laughter carrying as the scene fades out.

Not part of any scene, but something to be aware of. On the remainder of the drive back to the farm, I contacted and worked out deals with the 3 major dealers around Riverbend Springs. Making sure to avoid the ones that Julie believes to have been part of the Co-Op's shady deals.

Scene: Julie’s Room – Evening

The camera follows Julie and the protagonist as they walk through the hallway of the farmhouse. Julie pauses at her door, glancing back with a sly grin before opening it. Inside, the room is a whirlwind of color and chaos: a large map pinned to one wall dominates the space, covered in pictures, sticky notes, push pins, and strings connecting various points. The protagonist steps inside, their eyes wide with a mix of shock, concern, and admiration.

Protagonist (staring at the map):
“Julie… what is all this? Are you trying to solve crimes or start one?”

Julie (grinning):
“Welcome to the operation. This is how I keep everything straight. People, places, timelines—it all connects somehow, and I’ve got the receipts to prove it.”

The protagonist steps closer, studying the map. Pictures of Co-Op officials, local farmers, and equipment dealers are pinned alongside notes and documents. Strings crisscross the wall like a web.

Protagonist:
“This… is intense. I’m not sure if I should be impressed or concerned.”

Julie (laughing):
“I’ll take that as a compliment. It’s how Grandpa worked, you know. After you left, he turned his attention to me. Started teaching me the same things he taught you—how to look at the details, find patterns, ask the right questions. Except I think he figured I was a quicker learner.”

Protagonist (mock-offended):
“Oh, so now you’re smarter than me?”

Julie (smirking):
“Not smarter—just better at putting it all together.”

The protagonist shakes their head, looking around the room again, then gestures dramatically at the map.

Protagonist:
“And did Grandpa also teach you to be crazy? Because, Julie, look at this room. Does Mom even know it looks like this?”

Julie (rolling her eyes):
“Of course not. You know how she is. She thinks our rooms are our ‘safe spaces’ and won’t step foot inside. It’s up to us to take care of them, and, well… this is how I take care of mine.”

Protagonist (laughing):
“Safe space? Julie, this looks like something out of a crime drama. I half expect the FBI to burst in here any second.”

Julie laughs but crosses her arms proudly, clearly unbothered by the teasing.

Julie:
“Laugh all you want, but this is how I’ve connected the dots. It’s how I found out about the equipment dealers and the fuel contracts, and it’s how I know the Co-Op isn’t playing fair. You might call it crazy, but it works.”

The protagonist nods, still processing the level of detail in the room. Their tone softens slightly as they glance at her.

Protagonist:
“Alright, I’ll admit it. You’re good. Maybe even better than me at this. Grandpa would’ve been proud.”

Julie (grinning):
“He already was.”

The camera pans out, showing the protagonist and Julie standing together in the middle of her room, the chaotic brilliance of her setup surrounding them. The scene fades, leaving an air of mutual respect and sibling camaraderie.

he next scene is a quick funny family moment. I need to explain some of the dynamics of the family such as the room being your safe place. The entire family are smartasses to each other, constantly making jokes at one another's expense, that included Grandpa, Grandma, Mom, and Dad. The only exception is my father and I. We would joke but not to much, because neither of us could tell if we were being serious or joking. Which lead to quite a few arguments growing up. As far as rules go my Dad was only the muscle if you will. Dad believed the house was Mom's domain. What she said goes and if the kids wanted to do anything she was the person to ask. If we asked him to do something his response was always what did your mom say. Julie and I were more often found with my Mom, and Robert was mostly with Dad. Each person had the main thing we joked about on them. My mom the main thing we joked about is that she has an anti-green thumb, We never had a plant in the house more than 3 or 4 day before it was dead. Dad's main thin that was joked about was his memory, he would always ask if someone has seen something he just sat down. Me I was always made fun of as a computer nerd, I was always on it. My brother Robert was called dumb, we all knew he was very smart, but he always played the big dumb jock person and his size. He was not fat he is just big. At the age of 12 he was 6'3" and 275 pounds. Julie was the notebook, she got it from grandpa. He always had a notebook and a pen and pencil handy. He said the reason was, because if ever an idea came to mind he would write it down. He always said inspiration can come at any time, those who are unprepared to capture it, lack the vision to advance. Julie had her own saying. "Words that are only said aloud, are words that will be lost in memories.", anytime she said it Robert and I were quick to say "So write that shit down!", we were softly reprimanded for swearing in the house growing up. With that being said now that you have some background on the family dynamics the next scene is the family at the dinner table joking and having fun. I take the last roll, as Julie is about to ask for it. and she tries to get me in trouble with mom, and mom tells me to give her the roll. I give her a dirty look as I hand her the roll. then I smile and turn to mom and try to get her in trouble for the mess in her room, Mom doesn't care. It ends with me saying but mom I think she might need to be checked into a home or something jokingly of course.

Here’s the family dinner scene incorporating the playful dynamics and humor you described:

Scene: Dining Room – Evening

The family sits around the dinner table, a warm and inviting setting filled with chatter and laughter. Plates are half-cleared, and a platter in the middle holds the last roll. Julie eyes it, but just as she starts to reach for it, the protagonist swoops in and grabs it first, a smug grin on their face.

Julie (indignant):
“Mom! Did you see that? I was about to grab that roll, and he stole it right out from under me!”

Mom, sipping her tea, raises an eyebrow at the protagonist, her tone playful but authoritative.

Mom:
“Give her the roll.”

Protagonist (groaning, handing it over with a dramatic flourish):
“Fine. Here, your majesty.”

Julie takes the roll, sticking her tongue out at the protagonist before biting into it smugly. The protagonist narrows their eyes at her, then turns to Mom with mock seriousness.

Protagonist:
“Alright, if we’re playing fair, can I bring up something? Mom, have you seen her room? It’s a disaster zone. Like, I think it might be a fire hazard.”

Mom (calmly, without looking up):
“Not my problem. The kids’ rooms are their spaces. I don’t go in there.”

Protagonist (grinning):
“Okay, but I’m just saying—there are conspiracy theories less complicated than whatever she’s got going on in there. I think she might need to be checked into a home or something. You know, for her own good.”

The table erupts in laughter, Julie rolling her eyes but unable to hide her smirk.

Julie (sarcastic):
“Yeah, right. I’m not the one who used to spend 12 hours a day glued to a computer screen. Maybe you need to be checked into a home for computer nerds.”

Robert (grinning):
“Don’t forget his unhealthy obsession with spreadsheets.”

Protagonist:
“Hey! Spreadsheets are art! I make beautiful spreadsheets.”

The family laughs, Dad shaking his head as he leans back in his chair, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

Dad:
“You all talk big, but none of you could get a tractor running if your lives depended on it.”

Mom (smirking):
“And you can’t remember where you put your coffee mug half the time.”

Dad (mock-offended):
“Hey, now! That’s not true.”

Robert (pointing to the counter):
“Dad, isn’t that your mug right there? The one you were just looking for?”

The table breaks into laughter again, Dad sighing in defeat but chuckling along with them. Julie, still holding her roll, leans back smugly in her chair, and the protagonist shoots her a mock glare.

Protagonist (pointing at Julie):
“This isn’t over.”

Julie (grinning):
“Oh, it’s definitely over. Thanks for the roll.”

The camera pulls back, showing the family together at the table, the mood light and filled with warmth. The scene fades with the sound of their laughter echoing into the night.

Scene: Living Room – Evening

The camera opens with a shot of the cozy farmhouse living room. Mom, Dad, and Robert are seated on the couch, watching a sitcom on TV, their laughter and light commentary filling the room. Across the space, Julie and the protagonist are sitting on the floor, the coffee table pushed aside. Papers, notebooks, and documents are scattered between them. Julie flips through her notebook, occasionally passing notes to the protagonist, who types on a laptop.

The camera pans in closer on Julie and the protagonist as the voiceover begins.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“By the end of the day, we’d managed to pull everything together. Grandpa’s notes, Dad’s contracts, Julie’s research—it was all starting to make sense. And while there were still a lot of unknowns, we were making progress.”

The camera shows Julie gesturing animatedly with her pencil, explaining something as the protagonist nods and makes a note. Julie’s expression is focused, but there’s a hint of excitement as she works.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“Julie’s attention to detail was incredible. Every time I thought we were done, she’d point out one more thing we needed to include, one more connection we hadn’t made yet. It was like working with a younger, smarter version of Grandpa.”

The shot widens to include Mom glancing over from the couch with a fond smile, watching her kids work together. Dad shifts in his seat, muttering something to Robert, who chuckles softly.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“The farm’s future felt like it was hanging in the balance, but for the first time in a long time, I felt like we might actually have a chance. Tomorrow, though? Tomorrow was harvest day, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that farming doesn’t wait for anyone—not even family drama or shady Co-Ops.”

The camera lingers on the scattered papers and the siblings working side by side, their voices blending into the background as the voiceover continues.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“We still had a long road ahead of us, but at least now, we weren’t walking it alone.”

The camera pulls back, showing the entire family in the same room but in their separate spaces: Julie and the protagonist focused on the task at hand, and Mom, Dad, and Robert enjoying the evening together. The scene fades to black as the voiceover concludes.

Voiceover (Protagonist):
“Tomorrow was another day—and the work was just beginning.”

3. **Julie:** (cheerfully, but softly) “Morning, James!” She grabs a travel cup from the cabinet and fills it with coffee, adding just a splash of milk.
4. **James:** Looks up briefly, smiling faintly. “You’re up early. School doesn’t start for hours.”
5. **Julie:** (avoiding eye contact, a hint of mischief in her tone) “Yeah, but I’ve got some things to do first.” She zips up her satchel and secures it over her shoulder.
6. **James: (quizzically) “Things? You know what never mind. Plausible Deniability.” He raises an eyebrow but doesn’t press further, knowing Julie’s determination when she sets her mind to something.**
7. **Julie:** Leans down and kisses the top of James’ head. “I’ll have more information tonight.” Her voice lowers, almost conspiratorial. She gives a reassuring pat on his shoulder before heading for the door.
8. **James:** Watches her leave, a mix of curiosity and concern flashing across his face. He mutters under his breath, “Don't call me if you get arrested!”

**Mood:**

- As the door closes behind Julie, the camera lingers on James for a moment. He looks back down at his paperwork, distracted, then shakes his head and refocuses. The screen fades to black, signaling the transition to the next scene.

## Early Morning Investigation: Episode 4

**Setting:**

- Pre-dawn at the Co-Op’s grain and seed storage facility. The area is dimly lit by a few overhead floodlights, casting long shadows across the ground. The facility is quiet, the only sounds being the occasional creak of metal and the rustling of wind through nearby fields.

4. **Tension Builds:**

   - As she’s flipping through papers, a distant sound of voices and approaching footsteps makes her freeze. Julie quickly stuffs the papers back into their folder, places it carefully back into the filing cabinet where she found it, and extinguishes her flashlight.

5. **Escape:**

   - She ducks behind a stack of pallets as two men—security guards—walk past, their conversation inaudible. Julie holds her breath, waiting until they’re out of sight before slipping back through the fence.

6. **Mistake:**
   - In her haste to return the paperwork and extinguish her flashlight, Julie doesn’t notice her notebook slipping out of her satchel. It falls onto the floor of the office as she hurriedly puts the flashlight back into her bag. The notebook is left behind, partially hidden by the shadows.

## Ellie Faces the Community: Episode 4

**Setting:**

- Mid-morning at Ellie’s school. The teachers’ lounge is a modest space with a coffee station, a table piled with papers, and a bulletin board filled with school notices. Outside the windows, students pass by on their way to class.

**Characters:**

- **Ellie Spell:** Poised but tense, maintaining her composure despite the underlying stress of the family’s fight against the Co-Op.
- **Principal Karen Mills:** A well-meaning but easily influenced administrator with ties to the local Co-Op.
- **Other Teachers:** A mix of supportive and skeptical colleagues who provide an ambient layer of community sentiment.

**Action and Dialogue:**

1. **Ellie’s Entrance:**

   - Ellie enters the lounge carrying a stack of student papers. She exchanges brief greetings with the other teachers but senses a shift in the atmosphere as conversations grow quieter around her.

2. **Gossip Overheard:**

   - Ellie hears snippets of a hushed conversation from two teachers by the coffee station. “Did you hear about the Spells? Taking on the Co-Op? That’s gutsy… or foolish.” Ellie pauses but doesn’t confront them, choosing instead to head toward the bulletin board.

3. **Principal’s Approach:**

   - Principal Mills walks over, trying to appear casual but clearly intent on a discussion.
   - **Principal Mills:** “Ellie, can we have a word?” She gestures toward a quieter corner of the lounge.

4. **The Discussion:**

   - **Principal Mills:** (concerned) “I’ve been hearing some chatter about your family’s… situation with the Co-Op. I just want to remind you that our school thrives on community relationships. Perhaps now isn’t the time to stir the pot?”
   - **Ellie:** (calm but firm) “Karen, my family’s decisions are ours to make. I hope the school understands that standing up for what’s right isn’t stirring the pot.”

5. **Teachers’ Reactions:**

   - The room is largely supportive of Ellie. Several teachers nod in agreement, offering small gestures of encouragement like a pat on her shoulder or a murmured, "You’ve always done right by us, Ellie."
   - A few teachers, however, exchange whispers, their voices barely audible but filled with skepticism.
   - **Ellie:** (addressing the room) "Before the Co-Op existed, it was my family that supported and built this community. My step-father’s name is on the stadium because of what he contributed, not just in money, but in heart. Don’t forget that."
   - The supportive teachers grow more vocal, murmuring their agreement, while the skeptics fall silent, exchanging uneasy glances.

6. **Ellie’s Exit:**

   - Ellie ends the conversation gracefully, giving a polite smile.
   - **Ellie:** “Thank you for your concern, Karen. I need to get back to my students.” She leaves the lounge with her head held high, masking her internal frustration.

**Mood:**

- Social tension with an undercurrent of quiet defiance. Ellie’s composure highlights her strength and determination to face the growing challenges while hinting at the personal toll it takes on her.

**Transitions to Scene 4:**

As Ellie walks down the hallway, Julie enters the school through a side door near the teacher’s lounge, now back in the bright pink dress with white accessories she was wearing in the opening scene. Julie looks slightly frantic, fixing her hair as she stumbles and accidentally bumps into Ellie.

Julie: (quickly, trying to cover) "Hi, Mom. Fancy seeing you here. Okay, well, gotta go! Love ya, bye!"

She attempts to rush off, but Ellie grabs her arm and stops her.

Ellie: (firm but amused) "Young lady, I don’t want to know, but you missed this." (She picks a leaf out of Julie’s hair and holds it up.)

Julie: (relieved, with a sheepish grin) "Thanks, Mom." (She kisses Ellie on the cheek before running off to class.)

Ellie looks at the leaf in her hand, sighs, and mutters to herself, "That child is going to drive me to my grave."

The scene fades out as Ellie enters her classroom, transitioning to the next part of the episode.

## Late Night Revelation: Episode 4

**Setting:**

- Late at night in Julie’s room. The space is dimly lit by a small desk lamp. Her walls are adorned with notes, maps, and photos connected by strings, giving the room a conspiratorial vibe. The atmosphere is tense and secretive.

**Characters:**

- **Julie Spell:** Determined and confident, yet anxious about the implications of her findings.
- **James Spell:** Sitting on the edge of Julie’s bed, listening intently and trying to piece together the gravity of what Julie is sharing.

**Action and Dialogue:**

1. **The Setup:**

   - Julie paces her room, holding a stack of papers and her phone, occasionally gesturing toward the map on the wall.
   - **Julie:** (urgently) "You won’t believe what I found, James. They’ve been manipulating everything—prices, supply, distribution. And there’s more."

2. **James’s Reaction:**

   - James leans forward, trying to follow Julie’s explanation. He grabs one of the papers from her hand and scans it quickly.
   - **James:** (focused) "These are manifests? Shipping records? Wait… these date codes don’t match up."

3. **Julie’s Explanation:**

   - Julie nods, her expression growing more intense.
   - **Julie:** "Exactly. They’re selling older seeds to the non-Co-Op members and smaller farmers—people like Dad—while the big Co-Op players get the fresh stock. It’s a scam, James. They’re keeping the best for themselves and driving everyone else into a corner."

4. **The Risk:**

   - Julie sets the stack of papers down and turns to her bag.
   - **Julie:** "Yeah, I have more, in this notebook…"
   - She unzips her bag and stops, her face falling as she realizes there are only two notebooks inside. Panic sets in as she searches frantically through the bag.
   - **Julie:** "Where’s the third? Where is it?!"
   - She grabs and rifles through three other black bags scattered in her room, her movements growing more frantic. Suddenly, it hits her.
   - **Julie:** (horrified) "I must have dropped it at the facility."
   - She looks at James, panic in her voice. "We have to go get it, James! It has my name on it!"
   - **James:** (trying to calm her) "Julie, slow down. What’s in the notebook?"
   - **Julie:** (yelling) "My name, James! My fucking name!"
   - James stands, putting a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

[Previous scene continues...]

James sets his cup down, his expression shifting from shock to calculation. His fingers drum rapidly on his desk - a habit from his early trading days. Sarah recognizes the pattern and already has her Montblanc pen poised over her planner.

JAMES
(rapid-fire)
Sarah, I need full liquidation numbers. Everything - personal accounts, property holdings, market positions-

SARAH
(already writing)
The London properties as well?

JAMES
Everything.

B.D. straightens in his chair.

B.D.
Hold up. Why not just add the farm to your non-profit's list? You've helped what, thirty farms this quarter alone?

JAMES
(shaking head)
Can't. Dad would never accept that kind of help, especially from me.
(to Sarah)
Book me on the last flight out- 
(stops suddenly)
Shit. What time is it?

SARAH
Just past one, why?

JAMES
(standing abruptly)
I told Mom I'd be there tonight. In my family, tonight means dinner. Seven o'clock sharp or don't bother showing up.

B.D.
So catch a later flight-

JAMES
Five hours to drive, plus Dallas traffic...
(checking watch)
I need to leave now. Sarah, clear my schedule through next week. And get me those liquidation numbers as soon as you can.

SARAH
The Anderson merger meeting-

JAMES
Handle it. You know the numbers better than I do anyway.

B.D.
(smirking)
You really think you can keep this quiet? A multi-billion dollar firm suddenly liquidating assets? That's gonna raise a flag bigger than China's.

James grabs his jacket, already moving.

JAMES
Then find me a legal way around it. And Sarah? Get Julie on the phone. She'll tell me what Mom won't.

Sarah rises, straightening her suit.

SARAH
Your car's still in service. Take mine.

She tosses him her keys, which he catches one-handed.

JAMES
The Aston? You never let anyone-

SARAH
(small smile)
Just try not to wreck my car while saving your family farm.

B.D.
What your going to let him drive your Aston before me? Man, that's some bullshit

JAMES
(as he his opening his office door he stops and looks back his foot holding the door open)
Hey Bell, promise B.D. that if his family farm is on the verge of collapse you would let him drive your car.

SARAH
Absolutely not! I wouldn't let him in the passenger's seat much less the driver's seat.

(B.D. shots her a look and sets down his cup of tea)

James still standing with the door open
JAMES
Well people, let's go walk and talk

SARAH and B.D. jokingly make faces at each other and say "Right, Right" and the quickly follow James
