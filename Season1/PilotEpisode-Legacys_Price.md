FADE IN:

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Sunlight streams through worn curtains, illuminating a well-loved farmhouse kitchen. Bills are scattered across the oak table, most stamped with red "FINAL NOTICE" warnings. A foreclosure notice sits prominently among them.

ELEANOR SPELL (late 50s), still wearing her guidance counselor badge, sits at the table. Her hands tremble as she sorts through the bills.

ELEANOR
(to herself)
Robert, what have you done to us?

Through the window behind her, we see ROBERT JR. (20) working on a tractor. His massive frame makes the machine look small.

Eleanor reaches for her cell phone, then pulls back. She does this three times before finally picking it up.

She scrolls through her contacts, stopping on "James." Her thumb hovers over the name.

FLASHBACK - EIGHT YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A younger JAMES (early 20s) stands toe-to-toe with ROBERT SR. (late 40s).

ROBERT SR.
If you can't respect my decisions, then get out!

JAMES
Fine! But when you lose everything to this Co-Op, don't come crying to me!

James storms out. Through the window, we see Eleanor running after him in the rain.

BACK TO PRESENT

Eleanor takes a deep breath and presses "Call."

INT. SPELL COMMODITIES - RECEPTION - DAY

A pristine, modern office space in downtown Dallas. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a stunning view of the city skyline. Trading screens line the walls, but there are also touches of farm country - a worn leather saddle displayed like art, black and white photos of wheat fields.

Sarah sits at her desk, reviewing reports with her ever-present Montblanc pen. A proper tea service sits ready nearby.

B.D. exits the elevator, his tailored suit doing little to hide his athletic build. He tosses a protein bar onto Sarah's desk.

B.D.  
Your breakfast, your majesty.

SARAH  
(not looking up)  
American protein bars? How desperately common.

B.D.  
(leaning on her desk)  
They’re growing on you.

SARAH  
Like a fungus.  
(checks her watch)  
He’s late.

B.D.  
When isn’t he?

Through the glass walls, they watch James pace his office, phone to his ear. He’s in his element, commanding yet casual.

JAMES  
(into phone)  
No, tell them we’ll match any offer, but I want right of first refusal on future harvests.

Sarah and B.D. share a look—they’ve seen this dance before.

SARAH  
(to B.D.)  
Ten quid says he skips the board meeting.

B.D.  
Nobody’s taking that bet. Speaking of bets—  
(pulls out his phone)  
Check this out.

B.D. holds up the screen showing a news headline: "Hastings Law Clinches Landmark Agricultural Anti-Trust Case."

B.D.  
I believe that means you owe me a thousand quid, or whatever you call them in the Queen’s coin.

SARAH  
(sighs dramatically)  
Must you be so utterly American about it?

James sticks his head out of his office door.

JAMES  
Sarah, can you forward the Dewitt Farm contract with first refusal rights over to—  
(pauses)

James falters, realizing he doesn’t remember the name of the person on the phone. Sarah, noticing, doesn’t miss a beat.

SARAH  
Yes, Mr. Spell, I’ll send the Dewitt contract over to Richard immediately.

JAMES  
(signing "thank you" to Sarah)  
Yes, Richard. You’ll have the contract in the next five minutes. Review it and get back to me before the closing bell. Let’s lock this down.

James hangs up as B.D. turns his phone screen toward James, pointing at it. James glances at the headline, then at Sarah.

JAMES  
Crap.  
(pulling out wallet)  
Let’s pay the man.

B.D.  
(grinning)  
Told you I’d win it before summer.

SARAH  
(to James)  
This is your fault. You’re the one who bet against him.

JAMES  
And you’re the one who followed my bet.  
(hands B.D. cash)  
Happy?

B.D.  
Ecstatic. Now I can finally afford one of those fancy teas you keep pushing on me.

Their playful banter is interrupted by Sarah’s phone RINGING. She glances at the caller ID: "Eleanor Spell."

The atmosphere shifts instantly. Sarah's eyes meet James's before she answers.

SARAH
(professional tone)
Spell Commodities, Sarah speaking.
(gentle)
Eleanor, dear, it's wonderful to hear your voice. James has just returned from the morning board meeting. Let me transfer you straight away.

James is already moving toward his office, all traces of earlier levity gone. B.D. straightens, lawyer instincts kicking in.

INT. JAMES'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

James enters, closing the door just as his phone lights up. He takes a deep breath before answering.

JAMES
Mom?

INTERCUT BETWEEN JAMES AND ELEANOR

Eleanor sits at the kitchen table, bills spread before her. James stands in his modern office, Dallas skyline behind him.

ELEANOR
(barely a whisper)
James... I'm sorry...

JAMES
Mom, what's wrong?

ELEANOR
(voice breaking)
I promised your father I'd never... but James, we're losing everything.

James grips the phone tighter.

ELEANOR (CONT'D)
The Co-Op... the bills... they're taking the farm, baby.

James closes his eyes, fighting emotion.

JAMES
I'll be there tonight.

ELEANOR
Your father...

JAMES
(firmly)
Tonight, Mom. I promise.

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE

INT. JAMES'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

B.D. enters, his muscular frame filling the doorway.

B.D.
(upbeat)
Dagger, my man! What are the numbers telling you to-

He stops, noting James's expression as he hangs up the phone.

B.D. (CONT'D)
(serious)
That ain't your market face. That's your family face.

James doesn't respond, still processing the call. B.D. moves to the desk, hits the intercom button.

B.D.
(into intercom)
Hey Sarah, you might want to get your posh ass in here. My man isn't looking so good. And bring some of that fancy leaf water you're always pushing on us.

SARAH (V.O.)
(playfully haughty British accent)
I'll have you know it's proper English tea, you uncultured American. And for your cheek, you're not getting any of those biscuits you pretend not to love.

B.D.
(grinning)
Come on now, you know I only eat them to be polite.

SARAH (V.O.)
(laughing)
Is that why I caught you raiding my tea cart last week?

Sarah enters moments later with her silver tea service, her practiced elegance not quite hiding her concern for James. She pours three cups with practiced grace.

SARAH
(softly)
I take it Eleanor's call was as serious as I feared?

James wraps his hands around the teacup, finally finding his voice.

JAMES
They're losing the farm.

B.D. and Sarah exchange worried glances over their cups. Sarah unconsciously touches the leather-bound planner at her hip - already planning whatever comes next.

B.D. sets his cup down with unusual gentleness, his playful demeanor replaced by the focus that made him such an effective lawyer.

James sets his cup down, his expression shifting from shock to calculation. His fingers drum rapidly on his desk - a habit from his early trading days. Sarah recognizes the pattern and already has her Montblanc pen poised over her planner.

JAMES
(rapid-fire)
Sarah, I need full liquidation numbers. Everything - personal accounts, property holdings, market positions-

SARAH
(already writing)
The London properties as well?

JAMES
Everything.

B.D. straightens in his chair.

B.D.
Hold up. Why not just add the farm to your non-profit's list? You've helped what, thirty farms this quarter alone?

JAMES
(shaking head)
Can't. Dad would never accept that kind of help, especially from me.
(to Sarah)
Book me on the last flight out-
(stops suddenly)
Shit. What time is it?

SARAH
Just past one, why?

JAMES
(standing abruptly)
I told Mom I'd be there tonight. In my family, tonight means dinner. Seven o'clock sharp or don't bother showing up.

B.D.
So catch a later flight-

JAMES
Five hours to drive, plus Dallas traffic...
(checking watch)
I need to leave now. Sarah, clear my schedule through next week.

SARAH
The Anderson merger meeting-

JAMES
Handle it. You know the numbers better than I do anyway.

B.D.
(smirking)
You really think you can keep this quiet? A multi-billion dollar firm suddenly liquidating assets? That's gonna raise a flag bigger than China's.

SARAH
Your car's still in service. Take mine.

She tosses him her keys, which he catches one-handed.

JAMES
The Aston? You never let anyone-

SARAH
(small smile)
Just try not to wreck my car while saving your family farm.

B.D.
What you're going to let him drive your Aston before me? Man, that's some bullshit.

JAMES
(stopping at the door, foot holding it open)
Hey Bell, promise B.D. that if his family farm is on the verge of collapse you would let him drive your car.

SARAH
Absolutely not! I wouldn't let him in the passenger seat, much less the driver's seat.

B.D. shoots her a look and sets down his cup of tea with exaggerated offense.

JAMES
(already moving)
Well people, let's go walk and talk.

SARAH AND B.D.
(in mock unison)
Right, right.

INT. SPELL COMMODITIES - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

The three stand in the glass elevator descending sixty floors. Dallas spreads out before them, but James's mind is clearly elsewhere.

FLASHBACK - TWELVE YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - DINING ROOM

GRANDPA SPELL sits at the head of the table, everyone else waiting. His presence fills the room with quiet authority.

GRANDPA
In this family, dinner isn't just food. It's where we face each other. No matter what's happened, what's been said... we face it together.

Young James nods, soaking in every word. Julie, barely a child, scribbles in her notebook under the table.

BACK TO PRESENT

Sarah notices James's reflection in the glass, touches his arm gently.

SARAH
You still have time to pack a bag-

JAMES
No. Five hours to the farm, already pushing it for dinner.

B.D.
(checking his phone)
I can make some calls, get you a police escort-

JAMES
(small smile)
Through three states?

The elevator continues down, floor numbers ticking away. Another memory hits:

FLASHBACK - EIGHT YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Young James stands at the kitchen door, rain dripping from his clothes. The empty chair at the dinner table looms in the background. Eleanor reaches for him.

ELEANOR
James, please-

JAMES
(voice breaking)
I can't watch him run it into the ground, Mom.

INT. SPELL COMMODITIES - PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah's Aston Martin gleams under the fluorescent lights. Sarah practically dives for the center console.

SARAH
(typing rapidly)
Let me pair your phone before you-

JAMES
Sarah, I know how to-

SARAH
(cutting him off)
The last time you paired a phone to a car's system, you somehow managed to make it speak German.

B.D.
(leaning on the roof)
That was pretty funny though.

Sarah finishes the pairing, then leans down to the driver's window, deadly serious.

SARAH
Swear on your life, James, that you're not going to hurt my baby. This car is the third most important thing in my life.

B.D.
(standing behind Sarah)
Yes, right, after me and James, right?

JAMES
I swear that if I hurt your car, I'll buy you another in triplicate.
(remembering suddenly)
Sarah - my go bag's still at the office. Can you-

SARAH
Already arranged. Overnight delivery to the farm.
(beat)
Though I doubt your father will appreciate you showing up to dinner in yesterday's suit.

JAMES
Better than showing up in this one after five hours in your car.

He starts the engine. Sarah backs away reluctantly as James pulls out. The camera stays with B.D. and Sarah, watching the car disappear around the corner.

B.D.
But seriously, where do we sit? Like, top five? Top ten?

SARAH
James is probably fourth.

B.D.
And me?

A squeal of tires echoes through the garage. Sarah winces.

SARAH
Somewhere in the five hundreds.

B.D.
(chuckling)
He's gonna wreck your car.

SARAH
And you're paying for it.

B.D.
Wait, why me?

SARAH
(walking toward the elevator)
Because you're less important than him.

B.D.
(following her)
That's cold, Bell. Real cold.

They enter the elevator, their banter echoing as the doors close.

END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO

INT. ASTON MARTIN - LATE AFTERNOON

James speeds down the highway, Dallas shrinking in his rear view mirror. He fights with the car's touchscreen, jabbing at it with increasing frustration.

JAMES
Come on... Sarah's "superior" British engineering...

The screen flashes: "WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAIR YOUR DEVICE?"

JAMES
(mimicking Sarah's accent)
I already paired it, you pretentious piece of-

EXT. CO-OP STORAGE FACILITY PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

Julie's beat-up Honda Civic sits in the far corner of the lot, partially hidden by shrubs. Inside, Julie hunches over her phone, zooming in on the photo she just took.

INT. JULIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

The photo shows Mr. Willem in his western-style suit, standing awkwardly in his office. Behind him, clear as day, sits the box of date code stickers.

FLASHBACK - FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO

INT. MR. WILLEM'S OFFICE - STORAGE FACILITY

Mr. Willem adjusts his glasses nervously as Julie interviews him. His bolo tie seems to constrict with each question.

JULIE
(innocent school reporter voice)
And how long have you managed the facility, Mr. Willem?

MR. WILLEM
(muttering)
Just Ed is fine...
(louder)
Twenty years now. Though my family's been involved with local agriculture for generations.

Julie positions herself for the photo, carefully framing the shot.

BACK TO PRESENT

Julie swipes through photos frantically, her frustration mounting.

JULIE
(under her breath)
Move your damn hand, Ed!
(swipe)
Why didn't it focus?
(swipe)
Come on, come on...

She finds the clearest shot, zooms in with intense focus. Her nose nearly touches the phone screen as she squints at the box of stickers.

Suddenly - JAMES'S RINGTONE BLASTS AT FULL VOLUME. The sound fills the car like a thunderclap.

JULIE
(screaming)
JESUS CHRIST!

She fumbles the phone, nearly drops it, catches it against her chest. Her heart pounds as she tries to catch her breath.

INTERCUT BETWEEN JAMES AND JULIE

JULIE
(answering, breathless)
James? What's-

JAMES
How bad is it?

JULIE
(careful)
Define 'bad.'

JAMES
You sound out of breath. Since when do you exercise?

JULIE
(regaining composure)
Ha! Like you've ever seen the inside of a gym.

JAMES
Hey, farming counts as exercise.

JULIE
(scoffing)
When's the last time you touched a hay bale, city boy?

Through her windshield, she watches Mr. Willem hurry across the parking lot toward his white 2010 Infinity QX56. The massive SUV gleams under the afternoon sun - recently washed but showing its age in subtle chips and worn chrome. Mr. Willem fumbles with his keys, then has to grab the handle twice to hoist his short frame up into the driver's seat.

JAMES
Julie. The farm. How bad?

Julie bites her lip, weighing her words.

JULIE
There are some late notices, but Dad's got the wheat harvest coming in-

JAMES
(cutting her off)
Mom wouldn't have called if it was just late notices.

JULIE
(sitting straighter)
Mom called you?

JAMES
I'm on my way home.

JULIE
(momentarily forgetting her investigation)
What? When-
(realizing)
Oh God, you're trying to make it for dinner, aren't you?

JAMES
That's the plan.

JULIE
(teasing)
Well, you can't have your room back.

JAMES
Julie-

JULIE
(warming to the subject)
Nope. I claimed it fair and square. That's prime real estate now.

JAMES
(trying to steer back to serious matters)
The farm, Julie. What aren't you telling me?

Through the windshield, Mr. Willem is unlocking his car.

JULIE
(more serious)
James... why did Mom call you?

JULIE
(quiet)
Can you fix it, James?

The words hit him hard. Time seems to slow.

FLASH - TWELVE YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM

YOUNG JULIE (4) stands over a broken vase, tears in her eyes.

YOUNG JULIE
Can you fix it, James?

JAMES (18)
Already on it, squirt.

FLASH - ELEVEN YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - JULIE'S ROOM

YOUNG JULIE (5) holds up a broken toy tractor.

YOUNG JULIE
Can you fix it?

JAMES (19)
(taking it)
Easy. Give me five minutes.

FLASH - TEN YEARS AGO

EXT. SPELL FARM - BARN

YOUNG JULIE (6) points to a fallen bird's nest, her eyes wide with worry.

YOUNG JULIE
James, can you fix it?

JAMES (20)
(already climbing the tree)
Course I can. Birds'll never know it fell.

FLASH - EIGHT YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN

The night James left. YOUNG JULIE (8) watches her mother cry at the sink.

YOUNG JULIE
(whispered to herself)
James can fix it...

BACK TO PRESENT

James grips the steering wheel tighter, fighting emotion.

JAMES
(voice heavy with doubt)
I hope so, Jules. I hope so.

The clock ticks to 5:00 PM.

JAMES
(forcing lightness)
Okay, Jules, you're slowing me down. Love ya, see ya before seven.

JULIE
(soft)
I hope so, James. I hope so.

INT. ASTON MARTIN - CONTINUOUS

James ends the call. His eyes drift to the navigation screen: "Estimated arrival - 19:30."

JAMES
Like hell.

The engine ROARS as he pushes the accelerator to the floor.

EXT. TOWN HALL - AFTERNOON

Julie's Honda screeches into the parking lot, taking two spots in her rush. The building is a mix of modern additions and historical architecture, the words "FOUNDED 1889" carved above the entrance.

INT. TOWN HALL - RECORDS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A cramped room lined with filing cabinets. MISS HENDERSON (70s), the records keeper, looks up from her crossword puzzle as Julie bursts in.

MISS HENDERSON
Julie Spell, slow down before you-

Julie's bag catches a stack of papers, sending them flying.

MISS HENDERSON
(sighing)
-do exactly that.

JULIE
(already helping gather papers)
Sorry, Miss Henderson. I need the building plans for the Co-Op storage facility.

MISS HENDERSON
(checking her watch)
We close in twenty minutes.

JULIE
I know, I know. Please?

Miss Henderson studies Julie over her reading glasses.

MISS HENDERSON
Your grandfather never rushed in here like a tornado.

JULIE
(small smile)
No, he just charmed you into staying late.

MISS HENDERSON
(fighting a smile)
Section C, Cabinet 4. But I'm not staying past five.

Julie's already moving. She yanks open the cabinet, flipping through files with practiced speed. Her eyes scan each page, her special note-taking ability letting her absorb information rapidly.

She pulls out her phone, snapping quick photos of the blueprints.

Clock on the wall reads: 4:43 PM

INT. JULIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Julie slides into the driver's seat, immediately opening her notebook. She begins transferring details from the blueprints to her rough sketch, adding notes in her precise handwriting.

Through her windshield, Miss Henderson locks the records office door.

JULIE
(to herself)
Okay, Ed. Let's see how you're moving those seeds around.

Her phone BUZZES. Text from Robert Jr.: "Where are you? Mom's acting weird about dinner."

Julie glances at the clock: 4:52 PM

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ASTON MARTIN - LATE AFTERNOON

The sleek digital display in Sarah's Aston Martin reads: 4:52 PM

James's eyes flick between the clock and the speedometer, which is already well above the speed limit. Through the windshield, a sign reads: "ROAD WORK AHEAD - EXPECT DELAYS"

JAMES
No. Not today.

He slows slightly, frantically tapping the navigation screen, trying to find an alternate route.

JAMES
(exasperated)
God damn it, Lawrence, do something British!

NAVIGATION VOICE
Calling Her Majesty.

SARAH (V.O.)
If there's a single scratch on my car-

JAMES
Well, your majesty, I actually need help getting your fancy British butler to find me a detour. There's construction ahead.

SARAH
(sighs audibly)
Top left button, hold for three seconds, then say "alternate route" - and do try to sound properly English, the car's quite particular.

JAMES
Love ya, Bell.

He hangs up, slowing in traffic. Taking a deep breath, he holds the top left button.

JAMES
(practiced British accent)
Alternate route.

The navigation screen flickers. The car seems to straighten up in response.

NAVIGATION VOICE
(notably more crisp)
Yes, sir. Calculating alternate route now.

The screen refreshes: "Estimated arrival - 19:01"

FLASHBACK - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - DINING ROOM - 7:00 PM

The entire family seated around the table, steam rising from filled plates. GRANDPA SPELL at the head, GRANDMA SPELL beside him, then ROBERT SR., ELEANOR, JAMES (15), ROBERT JR. (7), and JULIE (3) in her booster seat.

GRANDPA
Amen.

FAMILY
(in unison)
Amen.

Plates begin passing. The room glows with warmth from the setting sun through the windows.

GRANDPA
(beaming with pride)
You should've seen Robert and James today. Working that field like they'd been doing it together their whole lives.

SARAH
(sighs audibly)
Top left button, hold for three seconds, then say "alternate route" - and do try to sound properly English, the car's quite particular.

JAMES
Love ya, Bell.

He hangs up, slowing in traffic. Taking a deep breath, he holds the top left button.

JAMES
(practiced British accent)
Alternate route.

The navigation screen flickers. The car seems to straighten up in response.

NAVIGATION VOICE
(notably more crisp)
Yes, sir. Calculating alternate route now.

The screen refreshes: "Estimated arrival - 19:01"

FLASHBACK - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - DINING ROOM - 7:00 PM

The entire family seated around the table, steam rising from filled plates. GRANDPA SPELL at the head, GRANDMA SPELL beside him, then ROBERT SR., ELEANOR, JAMES (15), ROBERT JR. (7), and JULIE (3) in her booster seat.

GRANDPA
Amen.

FAMILY
(in unison)
Amen.

Plates begin passing. The room glows with warmth from the setting sun through the windows.

GRANDPA
(beaming with pride)
You should've seen Robert and James today. Working that field like they'd been doing it together their whole lives.

YOUNG JAMES passes rolls to his father, their movements naturally in sync.

GRANDPA
(continuing)
James spots a problem with the seeder, Robert already has the tools ready. Didn't even need to speak. That's what farming's about - knowing each other so well you work like one person.

ROBERT SR. squeezes Young James's shoulder. Young Julie watches them with admiring eyes.

BACK TO PRESENT

James stares at the arrival time: 19:01. One minute late for dinner.

JAMES
(to himself)
Not good enough.

He pushes the accelerator harder. The nav screen flickers: 19:00.

INT. SPELL COMMODITIES - SARAH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah stands at her window, phone to her ear. B.D. enters with papers.

SARAH
Hold on- B.D.'s found something about the Co-Op.

The sound of shuffling papers comes through the speaker. B.D. spreads documents across her desk.

B.D.
(closer to phone)
James, they filed expansion permits last week.

JAMES (V.O.)
How big?

SARAH
They filed for doubling their storage capacity. Your family's south field is marked as a potential site.

JAMES
That's impossible. They'd need-

B.D.
(cutting in)
Yeah, but they're smart about it. It's buried in hundreds of pages of proposals. Just one possible location among many "potential development sites."

SARAH
The timing though, James... These were filed right after-

JAMES
After the foreclosure notice.

SARAH
(typing heard)
Looking at their other acquisitions, they've been buying up land around your farm for years. All through different corporate entities, all perfectly legal.

B.D.
Every transaction's clean. Every permit's in order. But something about this feels orchestrated.

JAMES
They're planning something.

B.D.
Problem is, planning isn't illegal. On paper, this just looks like smart business expansion.

Through the windshield, the sun is starting to lower. The clock reads 4:58 PM.

JAMES
Keep digging. There has to be something-

Suddenly, James's phone BEEPS with another call. It's Julie.

EXT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Julie's Honda pulls up to the house. Through her windshield, we see Eleanor through the kitchen window, hurriedly gathering papers from the table.

INT. SPELL FARMHOUSE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

Julie enters, her movements precise and practiced. As she talks, she's watching Eleanor's reflection in the entryway mirror while untying her shoes.

JULIE
(casually)
Mom, I swear the homecoming committee is trying to ruin everything. The colors they picked are going to completely clash with my dress.

She sets her shoes precisely in their spot, noting Eleanor's forced smile in the mirror.

JULIE
(continuing as she hangs her bag)
I mean, the designer specifically chose that shade of blue because it complements my eyes, and now Jessica wants to use orange in the decorations. Orange!

Eleanor moves papers from the kitchen table to a drawer, trying to appear casual. Julie pretends not to notice as she retrieves notebooks from her bag.

ELEANOR
(distracted)
That's nice, dear.

JULIE
(testing)
Nice? Mom, it's a disaster! You don't pair haute couture with orange streamers!

Eleanor normally would have corrected Julie's pronunciation of "haute couture." The fact that she doesn't speaks volumes.

Julie walks into the kitchen, her casual teenager act dropping away. She moves directly to the drawer, her hand reaching for the handle.

ELEANOR
(suddenly)
I called James.

Julie's hand freezes on the drawer handle. Eleanor stands by the sink, hands gripping the counter just like eight years ago.

ELEANOR
(soft, almost to herself)
I promised your father I never would, but I called him.

Julie slowly withdraws her hand from the drawer, turning to face her mother.

ELEANOR
(looking out the window)
He's coming for dinner.
(beat)
I don't know if that makes me a good wife or a terrible one.

Through the window, the sunset paints the kitchen in shades of orange and gold. The clock on the wall reads 5:23 PM.

ROBERT JR. enters the kitchen. Despite his size, he moves with surprising grace - a lifetime of knowing every inch of this house.

ROBERT JR.
(holding up camera and notebook)
Hey Jules, you left these in your car. Don't worry, I locked it up. Can't have just anybody getting in there.

Julie walks into the kitchen, her casual teenager act dropping away. She moves directly to the drawer, her hand reaching for the handle.

ELEANOR
(suddenly)
I called James.

Julie's hand freezes on the drawer handle. Eleanor stands by the sink, hands gripping the counter just like eight years ago.

ELEANOR
(soft, almost to herself)
I promised your father I never would, but I called him.

Julie slowly withdraws her hand from the drawer, turning to face her mother.

Hey Jules, you left these in your car. Don't worry, I locked it up. Can't have just anybody getting in there.

Julie's eyes go wide at the sight of her investigation materials.

ROBERT JR.
(continuing innocently)
Though I gotta say, for a school newspaper interview, you sure took a lot of pictures of-

JULIE
(cutting him off, too quickly)
Thanks! I'll need those for the article.

She practically snatches them from his hands. Eleanor looks between her children, momentarily distracted from her own worries.

ELEANOR
Article?

JULIE
(too brightly)
Yeah, just a boring piece about local businesses. Nothing interesting.

JULIE
(clutching her materials, looks at Eleanor)
Tell him, Mom.

She turns and rushes upstairs, leaving Eleanor and Robert Jr. in weighted silence. Robert Jr. moves to the fridge, his casual manner masking his concern.

ROBERT JR.
(pulling out milk)
Tell me what?

Eleanor turns back to the window, watching the sunset paint the fields gold.

ELEANOR
Your brother's coming home.

ROBERT JR.
James?

ELEANOR
For dinner.

Robert Jr. slowly lowers the milk jug, studying his mother's reflection in the window.

ROBERT JR.
Does Dad know?

Eleanor's silence is answer enough. Through the window, the wheat field ripples in the evening breeze.

ROBERT JR.
(gentle despite his size)
Mom... what's really going on?

Eleanor's shoulders start to shake. Robert Jr. steps forward, engulfing his mother in a protective embrace. Over his shoulder, we see the kitchen clock tick to 5:30 PM.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ASTON MARTIN - CONTINUOUS

The car's digital display reads 5:30 PM. James's knuckles are white on the steering wheel as he weaves through traffic.

NAVIGATION VOICE
You are now 85 kilometers from your destination. At your current, highly illegal speed, estimated arrival is-

JAMES
(cutting it off)
Not helping, Lawrence.

The sun hangs low on the horizon, casting long shadows across the highway.

FLASHBACK - TEN YEARS AGO

EXT. SPELL FARM - WHEAT FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

A broken-down tractor sits in the golden light. YOUNG JAMES (20), ROBERT SR. (mid-40s), and YOUNG ROBERT JR. (12) work together, tools scattered around them. Their movements are synchronized, each knowing their role.

ROBERT SR.
(from under the tractor)
Time check, James.

YOUNG JAMES
(wiping grease from his hands)
Five-thirty. If we hurry, we won't miss dinner.

ROBERT SR.
(sliding out)
Your mother would skin us alive.

YOUNG ROBERT JR.
(grinning)
Last one home has to explain to Mom why we're covered in grease!

The three race toward their truck, laughing, covered in dirt and oil but completely in sync.

BACK TO PRESENT

James blinks away the memory, his jaw tightening. Through the windshield, a sign reads: "ROAD WORK AHEAD - EXPECT DELAYS"

JAMES
No. Not today.
