# Chapter 1: The Call

The morning sun filtered through the farmhouse kitchen windows, casting long shadows across the bills scattered on the worn oak table. Ellie Spell's hands trembled as she sorted through them again, though she'd memorized every word: "Final Notice" in angry red letters, "Last Warning" stamped across payment demands. Her fingers lingered on the newest one - a certified letter she'd retrieved from the mailbox before Robert could see it.

The kitchen around her gleamed with its usual pristine order - copper pots hanging in perfect alignment above the stove, crystal glasses catching the sunlight through spotless cabinet doors, not a speck of dust on the antique China cabinet that had been her grandmother's. Everything in its place, just as it should be. No one looking at this kitchen would guess at the pile of final notices threatening to tear her family apart.

She glanced at the clock: 9:45 AM. James would be at work, probably in some important meeting. She'd made it a point never to call during business hours, not since he'd moved to Dallas and started his firm. That was their unspoken agreement - she respected his new life, and he called on Sundays to check in.

The phone sat heavy in her hand as she punched in the familiar numbers, her finger hovering over the last digit. She set it down, unfinished. Again. Third time in ten minutes.

"Just make the damn call, Ellie," she whispered to herself, the empty kitchen her only witness. "He needs to know."

She picked up the phone again, dialing. This time her finger hit the last number before she could second-guess herself. Each ring tightened the knot in her stomach. Just as she was about to hang up, a familiar voice answered.

"Good morning, Spell Commodities, this is Sarah speaking."

"Oh! Sarah, I'm sorry - I shouldn't have..." Ellie started to backpedal, relief and disappointment warring in her chest.

"Mrs. Spell! James just got out of a meeting. Let me transfer you right over."

"No, that's okay, I can call back later-"

"Nonsense! And by the way, that birthday cake recipe you sent was perfect - Amy couldn't stop talking about it. Just hold one moment while I transfer you..."

Before Ellie could protest further, the line clicked over to hold music. Her stomach clenched as she waited, knowing the next voice she heard would be her son's.

James had barely settled into his chair, fresh from a three-hour meeting with grain futures traders, when Sarah's voice came through the intercom. Her tone was playful, practiced from years of managing his office.

"Mr. James Spell, I have a Mrs. Eleanor Spell - aka your mommy - on line one. Since she never calls during business hours, I can only assume you're in trouble..."

The coffee mug stopped halfway to his lips. Sarah was right - his mother never called during work hours. Not once in eight years. His stomach dropped as he reached for the phone, forcing a light tone he didn't feel.

Back in the farmhouse kitchen, Ellie's grip tightened on the receiver as the line clicked.

"Hey Mom, what's up? Everything okay?" James tried to keep his voice steady, professional, though his heart was racing.

"Hi, honey." The familiar warmth of her voice wavered slightly. "I didn't want to bother you at work, but..." She paused, and James could picture her standing in the kitchen, twisting the phone cord around her finger like she always did when worried.

"Mom, what's going on?" His grip tightened on the phone. "Is everyone alright?"

"It's your father." She hesitated, the words catching. "He's... he's in trouble, but you know how he is. He's too proud to ask for help. Too stubborn to admit when he's drowning."

James leaned back in his chair, dragging his free hand down his face. "What kind of trouble are we talking about? Is he okay?"

"The farm. It's..." Another pause, longer this time. "It's worse than we let on. I don't know the details—he won't tell me everything. But I know it's bad, really bad. He's been so stressed. I'm worried about his health, about the farm, about everything."

"Mom, you're scaring me. How bad is it? What's going on?"

Ellie's voice cracked slightly as she struggled to find the words. "I just... I need you to come home. Just for the weekend. Talk to your father, please. He won't listen to me, but maybe he'll listen to you."

James glanced at his computer screen, packed with meetings and deadlines. "Mom, you know my job is insane right now. I can't just drop everything for a weekend."

"Please, honey." The desperation in her voice hit him like a physical blow. "He needs you, even if he won't admit it. We need you. It's not just about the farm—it's about your father. I think... I think he's losing hope. Just come home. Please."

The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken words. James stared at the Dallas skyline through his office window, his reflection ghosted against the glass. Finally, he let out a long breath.

"Alright, Mom. I'll come. But just for the weekend. We'll see what's going on, and maybe I can help straighten things out."

The relief in her voice was palpable. "Thank you. I knew I could count on you. Drive safe, honey. I'll see you soon."

She hung up before he could ask more questions, leaving him staring at the phone, the weight of her words settling over him. This wasn't just about the farm. Something bigger was wrong, and he needed to find out what.

Ellie's hands shook as she placed the receiver back in its cradle. The tears she'd been holding back finally broke free, rolling silently down her cheeks as she gripped the edge of the counter for support. She'd done it - broken their unspoken agreement, pulled him back into the mess they'd tried so hard to protect him from. But what choice did she have? The bills scattered across her immaculate kitchen table seemed to mock her desperation.

"Please let this be the right choice," she whispered, wiping her eyes with trembling fingers.

---

In his Dallas office, James sat motionless for a long moment, his mother's words echoing in his head. Finally, he pressed the intercom button.

"Sarah, I need you to move all my meetings to next week. Family emergency."

"Oh no, did your mom really call to tell me you're in trouble? Because I was just joking about-"

"Sarah." His tone cut through her attempt at levity, sharper than he intended. "Just... please handle the meetings."

A pause. "Of course, Mr. Spell. I'll take care of everything."

James sighed, rubbing his temples. "Sarah, I'm sorry. That was... I shouldn't have snapped. It's the farm. Dad's in trouble, and Mom's scared. I have to go home."

"Oh, James..." Her voice softened with understanding. "Go. I'll reschedule everything and hold down the fort here."

"Thanks." He ended the call and immediately dialed another number. It rang twice before a familiar voice answered.

"Hey, what's up, mother-"

"B.D., I need you to talk me out of doing something stupid."

"Well, good morning to you too, sunshine. What kind of stupid are we talking about?"

James leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. "Mom just called. The farm's in trouble. Dad's too proud to ask for help, but she wants me to come home for the weekend."

"Ah." B.D.'s tone shifted from playful to serious. "And by 'talk you out of it,' you mean you've already decided to go and want me to tell you it's not a terrible idea."

"Something like that." James started pacing his office. "You know how it ended last time. The things I said..."

"Look," B.D. interrupted, "you're going whether I say anything or not. But this isn't about being right or wrong anymore. Something's scared your mom enough to break the radio silence. That means it's bad."

"Yeah." James stopped at his window, looking out over the city. "Yeah, I know."

"Pack a bag, but don't pack light. Weekend visits have a way of turning into longer stays when family's involved. And James? Try to listen more than you argue this time."

James smiled despite himself. "When did you get so wise?"

"Around the same time you got so stubborn. Keep me posted, okay? And if you need legal eyes on anything..."

"You'll be my first call. Thanks, B.D."

James hung up and started gathering his things, B.D.'s words weighing on his mind. Pack for more than a weekend. The thought sent a chill down his spine - he hadn't spent more than two days at the farm since he left. Now, standing in his pristine office overlooking downtown Dallas, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was about to be pulled back into everything he'd tried so hard to escape.

James reached for the framed photograph on his desk - his grandfather perched atop an old John Deere tractor, grinning broadly beneath his worn baseball cap. The late afternoon sun caught the proud set of his shoulders, the quiet confidence in his weathered face. James ran his thumb across the frame, the memory washing over him unbidden.

"Your father," Grandpa had said, leaning against the barn door as they watched Robert Sr. disappear under yet another broken-down tractor, "he's got a gift with machines. Always has. But farming isn't just about keeping the equipment running - it's about knowing when to be on top of that tractor instead of under it."

Teenage James had nodded, understanding even then the gentle criticism in his grandfather's words.

"He sees the pieces," Grandpa continued, "but sometimes he misses the whole picture. Remember that, son. A farm needs both - someone to fix what's broken, and someone to see where we're heading next."

The memory faded as James set the photo carefully in his briefcase. His father had always been more comfortable with engines than economics, more at home with a wrench than a ledger. Maybe that's why things had gone so wrong. But now wasn't the time for old grievances - his mother's voice, trembling with worry, echoed in his mind.

James closed his briefcase and grabbed the small suitcase he kept in his office for unexpected business trips. Standing in the doorway, he took one last look around the corner office he'd built for himself - the wall of awards, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the evidence of eight years of relentless work.

He pressed the intercom button. "Sarah-"

"Yes, sir, your car will be ready by the time you reach the garage." A pause. "I'm sorry, James."

The formality of "sir" followed by his first name said everything about their relationship - the professional respect layered with years of friendship. He didn't need to explain; she already understood. Eight years of building this life, and one phone call was all it took to pull him back.

Sarah fell into step beside James as he left his office, her presence like a shield as they moved through the open workspace. She subtly raised her hand to ward off Andrew from Analytics, who was approaching with a stack of papers. A gentle head shake stopped Maria from Risk Management before she could leave her desk. The usually bustling office grew quieter as they passed, conversations dropping to whispers.

Everyone knew James Spell's door was always open. They'd seen him spend hours walking junior traders through complex deals, heard him laugh with the maintenance staff during late-night sessions. Now they watched him pass, briefcase in one hand, small suitcase in the other, his face set in stone.

"Is he okay?" The question followed in whispers to Sarah, from those who'd known him longest. She kept walking, her expression professional, but her worry evident to those who knew where to look.

At the elevator, Carson from IT started to step out, then quickly retreated at Sarah's pointed look. As the doors closed, James caught a glimpse of his office floor - people standing at their desks, watching with concern as their boss disappeared behind the sliding metal doors.

James stared at his reflection in the polished elevator doors, the memories hitting him as hard as the descending car's subtle drop in his stomach.

Five years ago, he'd brought Mom, Robert Jr., and Julie to see his new office. The space had been nearly empty then - just four rooms with basic desks, bare walls, and a view of other buildings' air conditioning units.

"This is it?" Julie had asked, thirteen and unimpressed, spinning in his desk chair. "I thought you said you were successful."

"Just wait," he'd told them, gesturing around the sparse space like a conductor before his orchestra. "One day, we'll have this whole floor. Trading desk there, analytics team here, risk management along that wall..."

Robert Jr. had snorted. "The whole floor? Why stop there? Why not the whole building?"

"Actually..." James had grinned, and Mom had laughed, pulling him into a hug.

"Dream big, honey," she'd said. "Just like your grandfather taught you."

The memory faded, replaced by a darker one. The barn, late at night, rain drumming on the metal roof. His father's voice, sharp with grief and anger, just two weeks after Grandpa's funeral.

"Planning? You want to talk about planning?" His father had thrown a wrench across the workspace, the clang echoing off the walls. "Your grandfather's not even cold in his grave, and you're already trying to change everything!"

"I'm trying to save us!" James had shouted back. "These contracts with the Co-Op - they're poison. Grandpa knew it, he was working on a way out-"

"Your grandfather isn't here anymore! This is my farm now, and we'll do things my way!"

The elevator doors opened to the garage, bringing James back to the present. Sarah stood beside him, her usual efficiency tempered by concern.

"Your car's ready," she said softly. "Do you want me to-"

"No," James cut her off, gentler this time. "No, I can handle it from here. Thank you, Sarah."

Sarah noticed Joseph approaching first, his arms full of the Whitford portfolio, worry etched across his face. She instinctively moved to intercept him, but James's hand on her shoulder stopped her.

"Thank you, Sarah. I'll handle this." His voice was gentle but firm. She nodded and stepped aside, understanding this was something he needed to do.

Joseph quickened his pace, papers threatening to spill from his grasp. "James, I've been running the numbers on Whitford's account. With the market volatility and these new contracts-"

"Joseph." James's calm tone cut through the younger man's anxiety. "Remember the last three weeks? How we ran those numbers every single day?"

"Yes, but-"

"Just believe in the numbers."

The words left James's lips before he realized what he'd said - his grandfather's voice echoing through the years. How many times had he heard that same advice, standing in the fields or bent over the kitchen table at 4 AM? 'Just believe in the numbers, son. They'll tell you everything you need to know.'

Joseph's shoulders relaxed slightly. He nodded, clutching the portfolio a little less desperately.

"Right. The numbers. Of course." A pause. "How long will you be gone?"

James reached for his car door. "As long as it takes. You've got this, Joseph. I trust you."

The words hung in the air as James slid into the driver's seat, another echo from his past - his grandfather's trust in him, now passed on to the next generation. He started the engine, watching in his rearview mirror as Sarah led Joseph back toward the elevator, already discussing the day's schedule.

James settled into the familiar leather seat of his Mercedes, each movement precise and practiced. Right hand adjusting the mirror, left hand inserting the key. A quick glance at his phone - 9:57 AM. Still early enough to avoid the worst of Dallas traffic, if you were heading into the city. Which he wasn't. Not today.

The engine purred to life as his fingers found their familiar position on the steering wheel - ten and two, always ten and two. He switched on his right turn signal, muscle memory from thousands of morning commutes. The radio came on automatically, Jim Carlton's market report filling the car with its usual morning certainty of numbers and projections.

"...futures trading higher this morning as Asian markets..."

Eight years of the same routine, same timing, same station. He could predict Carlton's inhales, the exact moment he'd pause for market numbers. But today the familiar voice felt foreign, distant. Today everything felt different.

The garage exit loomed ahead. Right turn for the office, left turn for home. Except home wasn't his downtown penthouse anymore. Home was eight hours away, down highways he'd sworn he'd never drive again.

His hand hesitated over the turn signal. Right was safety, routine, the life he'd built for himself. Left was the past, the arguments, the pain - and his mother's voice trembling with worry.

The left signal clicked on, echoing in the quiet car.

_Eight years earlier, he'd driven this same road in the opposite direction, his truck loaded with everything he owned, his grandfather's words still ringing in his ears: "A farm needs both - someone to fix what's broken, and someone to see where we're heading next." He'd gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles went white, promising himself he'd never look back._

Now here he was, turning left instead of right, watching the Dallas skyline recede in his rearview mirror. The market report droned on, but James wasn't listening anymore. His mind was already racing ahead, down the long highway that led to Riverbend Springs, to the farm, to everything he'd tried to leave behind.

He merged onto the highway, muscle memory failing him now. Every mile ahead was a mile into uncertainty, into a past he thought he'd escaped. The morning sun caught his rearview mirror, flashing bright in his eyes, and for a moment he could have sworn he saw his younger self in the reflection, sitting in that old truck, driving away from everything he knew.

The Dallas sprawl began to thin, strip malls giving way to open fields. James caught sight of the faded billboard he'd seen a thousand times before: "Dixon's Antique Tractor Museum - Next Exit." The painted image of an old Farmall tractor was weathered almost beyond recognition, but it still brought a smile to his face.

Three years ago, Julie had pressed her face against his office window, fourteen and trying to hide her boredom during the family's visit to the city. "Please tell me we're not just going to sit here and watch you stare at spreadsheets all day."

He'd grabbed his keys with a grin. "Actually, I know just the place."

Robert Jr. had groaned when they pulled into the museum parking lot. "Seriously? We leave a farm to look at old farm equipment?"

But their mom had brightened immediately. "Oh, your grandfather would have loved this place."

They'd spent hours there, Julie recording every detail in her ever-present notebook, Robert Jr. pretending not to be impressed by the massive steam engines. James found himself slipping into his grandfather's voice, explaining the evolution of farming technology, watching his siblings' feigned disinterest slowly turn to genuine curiosity.

"Look at this old International," he'd said, pointing to a rusted behemoth. "Grandpa's first tractor was just like this one. He used to say-"

"'You don't need new, you just need it to work,'" all three had finished in unison, dissolving into laughter.

Now, as the museum disappeared behind him, James realized that had been the last time they'd all been together, really together, without the weight of the farm's troubles between them. His hands tightened on the steering wheel as the open road stretched ahead, leading him back to everything he'd been trying to escape.

The growl in James's stomach pulled him from his highway trance. Nearly noon - he'd missed his usual 11:30 lunch meeting. His mind drifted to another meal, years ago, when timestamps weren't about market closings and client meetings, but about bringing the family together.

Sunday dinner at the farm. The memory was so vivid he could almost smell his grandmother's roast chicken and fresh-baked rolls. Julie was still a baby, cooing in her crib near the table while everyone gathered around. His grandfather at the head of the table, grandmother beside him, their presence filling the room with warmth. Mom passing dishes with practiced grace, Dad still in his work clothes, grease staining his fingers no matter how hard he'd scrubbed them.

"And then," ten-year-old James had announced proudly, "we learned that George Washington never actually chopped down the cherry tree! The whole story was made up to teach kids about honesty."

His father had paused, fork halfway to his mouth. "Hold on now. What do you mean 'made up'? Who told you that?"

"Mrs. Henderson, my history teacher." James had puffed up, sure of his facts. "She said it was just a myth."

"But why would someone make up a story about honesty?" Robert Sr. had pressed. "Seems backward. What else did she say about it?"

James had felt his face growing hot. "That's... that's all. It was just made up."

"Son, there's got to be more to it than that. When was the story first told? Who wrote it? You need to pay attention to these details."

"I'm not lying!" James had snapped, his voice rising. "That's what she said!"

"Nobody's calling you a liar," his father had started, but James was already pushing away from the table.

"Robert," his mother had warned softly, but the damage was done.

His grandfather's voice had cut through the tension. "James." Just his name, but it was enough to make him pause. "Your father's not questioning your honesty. He's teaching you to question everything else. There's a difference."

Sitting in his car, twenty years later, James felt the old frustration fade into understanding. His father hadn't been calling him a liar - he'd been trying to teach his son to dig deeper, to look beyond the surface. The same way James now taught his traders to verify every number, question every trend.

His stomach growled again, snapping him back to current time. A road sign caught his eye: "Next Services 35 Miles." Again his stomach groaned. Then he looked at the time, oh no he was running late. James accelerated, needing to make up time he'd lost to memories. The irony wasn't lost on him - all those years of his father teaching him to pay attention to details, and he'd let himself get distracted by the past when he needed to focus on the possible future.

The traffic on I-30 slowed to a crawl as Little Rock's skyline appeared on the horizon. On the shoulder ahead, a father and son were hunched over the smoking engine of an old pickup truck, tools scattered around them, working in silent synchronization. The sight tugged at something in James's memory.

Harvest season, ten years ago. The ancient combine had chosen the worst possible moment to break down - wheat ready for cutting, storm clouds gathering in the distance, and three generations of Spell men gathered around the ailing machine.

"Hand me that wrench, James." His father's voice had been muffled, coming from somewhere inside the combine's mechanics. No irritation, no argument, just focused concentration. "Quarter-inch."

James had known exactly which one without asking - years of watching his father work had taught him that much. Grandpa had stood nearby, one eye on the gathering clouds, the other on his son and grandson working in rare harmony.

"Timing chain's slipped," Robert Sr. had called out. "We fix this now, we might beat the rain."

"If we reroute the auxiliary belt," James had suggested, the solution clicking into place, "we could bypass the damaged section. At least until we finish this field."

His father had emerged from under the panel, grease-streaked but grinning. "Now you're thinking like a mechanic."

"And you're both thinking like farmers," Grandpa had added approvingly. "Racing the weather, improvising with what you've got. That's what this life is about."

They'd fixed the combine in record time, the three of them moving like parts of a well-oiled machine themselves. Made it through the whole field before the first raindrops fell.

A horn honked behind him, pulling James back to the present. The traffic ahead was at a standstill, brake lights stretching into the distance. He glanced at the clock: 4:30 PM. His analytical mind quickly calculated the remaining distance, factored in the traffic he could see, and came to an unavoidable conclusion. There was no way he'd make it by seven.

Better to call now than risk his mother's disappointment. James wasn't sure what scared him more - the thought of missing dinner or facing whatever situation had driven her to call him in the first place. But being late for dinner? That was a clear and present danger.

He reached for his phone, hitting speed dial before he could second-guess himself. The traffic inched forward as the phone rang.

The afternoon sun slanted through the kitchen windows, casting warm light across Ellie's cookbook shelf. She pulled out a well-worn recipe card, its edges soft from years of use, her mother-in-law's handwriting faded but still legible. Pot roast with rosemary potatoes - both her boys' favorite, though neither would admit they shared anything in common these days.

"A proper meal," she muttered to herself, laying out ingredients with practiced precision, "might remind them they're not so different after all."

She pulled up her playlist on her phone, the one she used for serious cooking sessions. Elvis Presley's "Can't Help Falling in Love" filled the kitchen - another thing her boys shared without knowing it. Both would absently hum it whenever they worked, just like she did.

Ellie swayed slightly as she chopped vegetables, her voice joining Elvis's. "Take my hand, take my whole life too..." The knife moved in rhythm with the music, decades of muscle memory guiding her hands while her mind wandered to tonight's dinner. Would James make it in time? Would Robert behave himself? Would-

Her phone buzzed against the counter, James's name lighting up the screen. Her heart skipped a beat as she quickly wiped her hands on her apron.

Ellie took a deep breath, composing herself before answering. "Hey, sweetie. You're lucky I only just started my cooking groove. Oh, by the way, you're on speaker and your sister should be home any minute, and I haven't been able to tell anyone yet."

James's chuckle crackled through the phone's speaker. "Going full Mom Mode on me already? I've barely made it to Little Rock."

"Little Rock?" Ellie's knife paused mid-chop. "James David Spell, please tell me you're not calling to say you'll be late for dinner."

"Now Mom, there's traffic and-"

"I'm making pot roast." She wielded the information like a gentle weapon.

A pause on the other end. "With the rosemary potatoes?"

"Mmhmm." She smiled, knowing she had him. "And those yeast rolls you and your father pretend not to fight over."

"Mom..." The word carried equal parts guilt and pleading. "The traffic's backed up for miles. I'm trying, I swear, but-"

"Seven o'clock, James. It's always been seven o'clock in this house."

"I know, I know. But maybe tonight-"

The screen door's familiar creak cut him off, followed by the sound of Julie's voice calling out, "Mom! You'll never believe what I found out today!"

"Mom! You'll never believe what these people want to do to MY homecoming!" Julie's voice echoed through the house, followed by the methodical thump of boots being removed. "They actually suggested using the alternate school colors. Can you imagine? Navy and silver instead of royal blue and gold? And now I have to call Jean-Pierre about adjusting my dress because apparently, the one he sent - you know, the pink one I told you about? - it's going to clash completely with the new color scheme if I don't win this fight, which I will, obviously, but still-"

Julie's voice carried on as she went through her routine - boots placed precisely in their spot, bag hung on its designated hook. Each movement was exact, practiced, perfect, despite her seemingly scattered rambling.

"And then Mrs. Henderson had the nerve to suggest we scale back the decorations! On MY homecoming! I mean, really, who does she think-" Julie paused, suddenly aware of the unusual silence in the house. No response from her mother, no sounds of cooking, just... nothing.

"Mom? Are you even listening to me?"

Julie turned the corner into the kitchen and stopped short. Her mother stood with arms crossed, one eyebrow raised in that way that always made Julie feel about five years old, regardless of what she'd been up to that morning at the storage facility.

"Oh," Julie said, her voice smaller now. "What did I miss?"

"Hi, Julie," James's voice came through the phone speaker, amusement clear in his tone.

Julie's eyes widened, her homecoming rant forgotten. "James?"

Julie practically bounced across the kitchen, her earlier composure forgotten. "James! Oh my god, you'll never believe what Rob and I found last weekend! There's this absolutely perfect International truck - it's like, crazy vintage, probably from the sixties? The paint's all faded but the body's in really good shape and-"

"Julie," James interrupted, laughter in his voice, "why exactly would I be buying you a truck for homecoming?"

"Because you're my favorite brother who works in the city and makes tons of money?" She perched herself on the counter next to the phone, ignoring her mother's pointed look about sitting on kitchen surfaces. "And because Rob says it's actually not that bad mechanically, it just needs-"

"Hold on," Ellie cut in, wooden spoon raised like a conductor's baton. "Is this the same truck your father specifically told you both to stay away from because, and I quote, 'that thing's more rust than metal'?"

"Mom!" Julie protested, then quickly switched tactics. "James, you haven't even heard the best part. The owner's only asking-"

"Jules," James interrupted again, "I'm kind of in the middle of explaining to Mom why I might be late for dinner."

Julie's eyes widened as she looked at the clock. "Late? For dinner? Oh, you are so dead."

"Not as dead as you will be if you don't get your damn ass off my kitchen counter, young lady."

Julie's feet hit the floor before Ellie finished the sentence. The words "young lady" acted like a reset button, snapping her from playful teenager to proper daughter in an instant. She planted a quick kiss on her mother's cheek.

"Sorry, Mom. Okay, gotta go!" Julie's footsteps thundered up the stairs, leaving a wake of energy behind her.

"That girl," Ellie mumbled, shaking her head. James's quiet laughter crackled through the phone speaker, reminding her he was still there. She turned back to the phone, her voice shifting from maternal exasperation to maternal warning without missing a beat.

"What's so funny, mister? You know the rules. Seven o'clock. Don't be late."

She hung up before he could protest, turning her music back on with a satisfied tap. From upstairs, Julie's voice immediately joined Elvis's, floating down through the old farmhouse halls. Ellie smiled to herself as she returned to her cooking, knife moving in rhythm once again.

James jabbed at the radio buttons, scanning through stations. Country, pop, static, commercial - nothing about traffic conditions. The sea of brake lights stretched endlessly ahead as his fingers moved faster, more frustrated with each useless station.

The desperate search for traffic information triggered a memory he'd tried hard to forget - the only time he'd been late for dinner after Grandpa passed. That night had changed everything.

He'd been reviewing the farm's books, trying to make sense of the Co-Op contracts his father had signed. The numbers hadn't added up, and he'd lost track of time. When he'd finally looked up, it was already 7:30.

His father had been waiting at the kitchen table, dinner growing cold, his face dark with anger.

"Where the hell have you been?"

"Dad, listen, these contracts - something's not right. The interest rates, the terms-"

"Dinner," his father had cut him off, "is at seven. Always has been."

"Would you just look at these numbers?" James had shoved the papers across the table. "They're bleeding us dry and you don't even see it!"

"What I see," Robert Sr. had stood up slowly, "is my son thinking he knows better than his father. Thinking some fancy college education means he understands farming better than the man who's done it his whole life."

"Grandpa would have never-"
